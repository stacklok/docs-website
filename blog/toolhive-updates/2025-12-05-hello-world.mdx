  Introducing the ToolHive Updates section to keep you informed about the latest
  developments.

We're launching this Updates section to keep you informed about what's new with
ToolHive.

{/* truncate */}

Expect regular posts here covering:

- Platform updates and improvements
- Developer resources and guides
- New MCP servers added to the registry
- Community highlights

This is a new initiative, so the format will evolve based on what's useful. If
there's something specific you'd like us to cover in these updates, let us know.

Check back next week for the first full update!
