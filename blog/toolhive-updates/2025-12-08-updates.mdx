  Introducing the ToolHive Registry Server, Virtual MCP Server (vMCP), and new
  management features for the ToolHive UI
---

A big week for ToolHive: we shipped a new **Registry Server** for managing and
curating MCP servers at scale, expanded the **ToolHive UI** with registry-based
installs and richer tool controls, and introduced **Virtual MCP Server (vMCP)**
for consolidating many MCP backends into one secure, workflow-aware endpoint.

### ToolHive Registry Server: Unified registry management and discovery

ToolHive now includes a dedicated [Registry Server](/toolhive/guides-registry/)
that aggregates multiple registry sources, keeps them in sync, and helps teams
publish a curated "desired" registry. This enables you to:

- Connect multiple registry backends (Git repositories, local or remote files,
  internally-managed entries, Kubernetes workloads, or upstream MCP Registry API
  servers).
- Auto-discover MCP servers deployed in Kubernetes.
- Automatically synchronize changes across registry sources.
- Curate what users see via include/exclude filtering.
- Use an authenticated
  [cloud-based UI](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-cloud-ui) to view
  running MCP servers.

### ToolHive UI: Registry groups and tool customization (GA)

The [ToolHive UI](/toolhive/guides-ui/) gained new features to standardize
installs and tailor tool experiences. You can now:

- Install **MCP server groups** directly from a custom registry.
- **Customize tools** to disable unnecessary tools and edit their names and
  descriptions for better AI performance and token/cost savings.

### Virtual MCP Server: One endpoint for many servers and workflow automation

[Virtual MCP Server (vMCP)](/toolhive/guides-vmcp/) simplifies operating many
MCP servers in Kubernetes and building cross-system workflows. It enables you
to:

- Aggregate multiple MCP servers behind a single endpoint and automatically
  resolve tool name conflicts.
- Define declarative, multi-step tool workflows with parallel execution,
  conditionals, error handling, and approval gates.
- Filter, rename, and wrap upstream tools to enforce policies and present
  simpler interfaces.
- Pre-configure defaults for common parameters to reduce repetition and prevent
  mistakes.
- Separate auth boundaries: clients authenticate once to vMCP while vMCP manages
  backend credentials for SSO, centralized access control, and auditing.

### Ecosystem updates

The ToolHive ecosystem continues to grow with support for new clients and MCP
server integrations.

Client support:

- **Zed**: ToolHive now supports managing MCP configurations in Zed

New MCP servers in the built-in registry:

- **PagerDuty**: Monitor and manage incidents
- **Prometheus**: Query metrics and monitor systems
- **Redfish** (from Nokia): Manage server hardware
- **SonarQube**: Analyze code quality
- **ToolHive Documentation Search**: Search ToolHive docs directly
