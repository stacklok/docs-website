description:
  Multi-instance sync and auto-discovery for ToolHive Registry Server.
  Production observability for vMCP with OpenTelemetry metrics and distributed
  tracing.
---

This week, we focused on operational readiness and flexibility: the Registry
Server now auto-discovers server types and scales sync across multiple registry
instances, Virtual MCP Server (vMCP) gained OpenTelemetry observability and
smarter composite tools, and both the CLI and UI now fully support the ToolHive
Registry Server.

### ToolHive Registry Server: Smarter discovery and scalable sync

The **Registry Server** now features improved auto-discovery capabilities and
sync architecture. You can now:

- Automatically detect whether an auto-registered server is an `MCPServer`,
  `VirtualMCPServer`, or `MCPRemoteProxy`.
- Scale sync jobs across multiple registry instances with an improved sync
  implementation.
- Deploy without hardcoded namespaces; the registry server now auto-discovers
  its operating namespace.
- Connect the **ToolHive CLI and UI** to your Registry Server, bringing
  effortless discovery and deployment to your custom registry.

### Virtual MCP Server: Observability and composite tool improvements

**vMCP** gained production-grade observability and extended composite tool
capabilities.

You can now:

- Expose OpenTelemetry metrics on the standard Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint
  (request counts, latencies, backend health, active connections) and export
  distributed traces for backend client and workflow calls, enabling
  comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and debugging.
- Define default results for skippable composite tool steps, ensuring workflows
  behave predictably across all conditional branches.
- Use non-string arguments in composite tools, enabling structured output
  references for conditional logic, downstream step arguments, and final
  outputs.
- Include `MCPRemoteProxy` resources in MCPGroups, allowing remote MCP servers
  to aggregate alongside local servers in your VirtualMCPServer configuration.
