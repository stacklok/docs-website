This week ToolHive added production-ready features that teams need for
enterprise deployment: audit logging and health monitoring for vMCP, API-driven
registry management, and direct registry connections in the UI.

### Virtual MCP Server: Audit logging, health checking, and composite tool improvements

vMCP adds more operational capabilities that teams need for production
deployments:

- **Health monitoring** tracks which MCP servers behind vMCP are available and
  responding, the foundation for building alerts and dashboards that keep your
  AI workflows running smoothly.
- **Audit logging** captures workflow events (started, completed, failed) via
  CRD configuration, giving you the compliance trail and debugging context
  required for regulated environments.
- **Composite tools are more powerful**: Reference deeply nested fields using
  `{{.steps.X.output.field.nested}}` syntax, and use the new `fromJson` function
  to work with MCP servers (like GitHub) that return JSON as plain text. This
  enables cleaner conditional logic and more flexible workflows.

### ToolHive Registry Server: API management and deployment improvements

Managing registries is now more flexible and automated:

- **API-based management** lets you add, update, or remove registries
  programmatically, useful for CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code
  approaches.
- **Simplified authentication**: Configure auth settings directly in the
  Registry CRD instead of managing separate configuration files. Database
  credentials specified in the CRD automatically provision `pgpass` files,
  reducing manual setup.
- **Kubernetes deployment**: A new Helm chart (publishing soon) makes cluster
  deployments more straightforward.

### ToolHive UI: Live registry connections

The ToolHive UI now connects directly to standards-compliant registry API
servers like the ToolHive Registry Server. Instead of importing static JSON
files, you get live registry data, making it easier to browse and discover
available MCP servers in your environment.
