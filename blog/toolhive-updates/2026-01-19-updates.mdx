  Improved proxy configuration in the ToolHive UI, bearer token authentication
  for remote servers, backend health monitoring for vMCP, and MCP client sync
  from Cloud UI.
---

Welcome to 2026! The ToolHive team is back into the swing of things after the
holiday break, focusing on improved operational resilience and streamlined
developer workflows: vMCP gained backend health monitoring for production
environments, the CLI and desktop UI added bearer token authorization for remote
servers, the desktop UI added flexible proxy configuration, and Cloud UI now
displays MCP configurations for your IDE clients, with one-click setup for
Cursor.

### Virtual MCP Server: Health monitoring and composite tool fixes

**vMCP** adds operational capabilities that teams need for production
deployments:

- **Backend health monitoring** detects and handles unreachable servers
  gracefully, reducing user-facing errors when individual MCP servers restart or
  become temporarily unavailable.
- **Composite tool fixes** ensure type coercion in templates works correctly and
  error continuation behaves as expected, so multi-step workflows complete
  reliably even when intermediate steps encounter issues.

### ToolHive desktop UI: Proxy configuration and stability

The **desktop UI** gives you more control over how MCP servers connect:

- **Custom proxy ports** simplify deployment in environments with specific port
  requirements or when running multiple instances.
- **Stability improvements** through upgraded core dependencies (Electron,
  ai-sdk) and fixes for form validation and environment variable handling reduce
  crashes and unexpected behavior.

Behind the scenes, we've expanded automated testing with Playwright, and work is
underway to align CLI and Desktop UI versioning through bundling.

### CLI and desktop UI: New auth option for remote servers

The **CLI and desktop UI** now support bearer token authentication for remote
MCP servers, enabling secure connections to authenticated endpoints, such as
enterprise APIs or hosted services, without manual credential handling in each
request.

### Cloud UI: Easier client setup

**Cloud UI now displays client-specific configurations for MCP servers**
(Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Code), making setup easier. For Cursor, a single
click opens the configuration directly; for VS Code and Claude Code, copy the
ready-to-use config or command.
