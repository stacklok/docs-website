This week delivers capabilities that production teams need: vMCP now
auto-discovers backend servers without restarts and reports operational health
in CRD status fields, the Registry gains OpenTelemetry support and tool
definition APIs, and both the CLI and Desktop UI add custom header configuration
for remote MCP connections. We've also added custom CA support for organizations
running private identity providers.

### Virtual MCP Server: Dynamic discovery and operational status

[**vMCP**](/toolhive/guides-vmcp/) gains capabilities that eliminate manual
intervention and improve visibility:

- **Dynamic backend discovery** detects servers added or removed from an
  MCPGroup and updates routing automatically, eliminating pod restarts when
  changing your MCP backend topology.
- **Static configuration mode** provides an alternative for security-conscious
  deployments where vMCP requires zero Kubernetes API access; choose between
  operational convenience and minimal attack surface based on your security
  requirements.
- **Operational status reporting** now surfaces deployment health and backend
  server status in the CRD status field for improved debugging and monitoring
  integration.

### Registry: OpenTelemetry and tool metadata

**The ToolHive [Registry Server](/toolhive/guides-registry/)** expands its
observability and developer experience:

- **OpenTelemetry support** enables integration with your existing observability
  stack for tracing and monitoring registry operations.
- **Tool definitions** can now be specified in MCPServer CRDs and are exposed
  via the API, so MCP server entries in the registry can display their available
  tools.

### CLI and Desktop UI: Header configuration for remote servers

**The CLI and Desktop UI** now support custom header configuration for remote
MCP connections, useful when services require specific headers beyond standard
authentication. Configure non-sensitive headers directly, or reference encrypted
secrets for sensitive values like API keys.

### Kubernetes Operator: Custom CA support

**The
[MCPServer CRD](/toolhive/reference/crd-spec#apiv1alpha1inlineoidcconfig)** now
supports custom certificate authorities, enabling ToolHive to validate OAuth
tokens issued by private on-premises identity provider instances, essential for
organizations with internal PKI infrastructure.

**Getting started**
