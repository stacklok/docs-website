ToolHive automatically configures supported AI clients to work with MCP servers.
This guide shows you how to set up and manage client configurations.

## Understanding client configuration

Before an AI application can use ToolHive MCP servers, it needs to know where to
find them. You can configure clients in two ways:

1. **{props.term} a supported client**: {props.term} your client with ToolHive
   so it automatically manages and updates the client's configuration as you
   start, stop, and remove MCP servers.
2. **Manual configuration**: For clients that ToolHive doesn't directly support,
   manually configure them to connect to ToolHive-managed MCP servers using the
   SSE or Streamable HTTP protocol.

For a complete list of supported clients and compatibility details, see the
[Client compatibility reference](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx).
