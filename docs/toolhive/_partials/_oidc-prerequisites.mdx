Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ToolHive installed and working
- Basic familiarity with OAuth, OIDC, and JWT concepts
- An identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC), such as Google,
  GitHub, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Okta, Auth0, or Kubernetes (for service
  accounts)

From your identity provider, you'll need:

- Client ID
- Audience value
- Issuer URL
- JWKS URL (for key verification)

ToolHive uses OIDC to connect to your existing identity provider, so you can
authenticate with your own credentials (for example, Google login) or with
service account tokens (for example, in Kubernetes). ToolHive never sees your
password, only signed tokens from your identity provider.

For background on authentication, authorization, and Cedar policy examples, see
[Authentication and authorization framework](../concepts/auth-framework.mdx).
