Thank you for your interest in contributing to ToolHive! This page provides an
overview of the project's architecture and links to resources for contributing
to each component.

## Project overview

ToolHive is composed of several independently developed components, each with
its own codebase, contributing guide, and development workflow. The components
work together to provide a complete platform for running and managing Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

All ToolHive components are open source and licensed under the Apache 2.0
license.

## Project components

### ToolHive CLI, API, and Kubernetes Operator

The core ToolHive repository contains the command-line interface, API server,
and Kubernetes operator. These components share a common codebase and provide
the runtime environment for deploying and managing MCP servers.

**Repository**: [stacklok/toolhive](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive)

**Key resources**:

- [Contributing guide](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Developer documentation](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/blob/main/docs/README.md)
- [Kubernetes Operator developer guide](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/blob/main/cmd/thv-operator/README.md)
- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/issues)

### ToolHive desktop UI

The ToolHive Desktop UI is a cross-platform application that provides a
graphical interface for discovering, installing, and managing MCP servers. It's
built with TypeScript and Electron, and runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Repository**:
[stacklok/toolhive-studio](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio)

- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/issues)

### Registry server

The Registry Server is an API server that implements the official MCP Registry
API. It provides standardized access to MCP servers from multiple backends,
including file-based and other API-compliant registries.

**Repository**:
[stacklok/toolhive-registry-server](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry-server)

**Key resources**:

- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry-server/issues)

### Built-in registry

The built-in registry contains the curated list of MCP servers available in
ToolHive. If you want to add a new MCP server to the registry, this is the
repository to contribute to.

**Repository**:
[stacklok/toolhive-registry](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry)

**Key resources**:

- [Submit a new MCP server](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry/issues/new?template=add-an-mcp-server.md)
- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry/issues)

### Dockyard

Dockyard is a tool that packages MCP servers into containers. It handles the
containerization process, making it easy to run MCP servers in isolated
environments.

### MCP Optimizer

The MCP Optimizer acts as an intelligent intermediary between AI clients and MCP
servers. It provides tool discovery, unified access to multiple MCP servers
through a single endpoint, and intelligent routing. The optimizer reduces token
usage by narrowing down the toolset to only relevant tools for each request.
