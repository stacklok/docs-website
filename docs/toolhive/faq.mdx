## General questions

### What is ToolHive?

ToolHive is an open source platform that simplifies the deployment and
management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It runs MCP servers in
secure, isolated containers and provides tools to manage them easily. You can
run ToolHive as a graphical desktop app, command-line tool, or Kubernetes
operator.

### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a protocol that allows AI applications to connect to external data
sources and tools. It provides a standardized way for AI models to access
real-world context like APIs, source code repositories, databases, and other
systems. Think of it as a bridge between AI models and the external systems
where your data and applications live.

### Do I need to know how to code to use ToolHive?

No. ToolHive includes a graphical interface that doesn't require coding
knowledge. However, some MCP servers may require configuration or secrets, such
as API keys, that you'll need to set up. The ToolHive CLI is more technical but
comes with comprehensive documentation.

### Is ToolHive free to use?

Yes, ToolHive is open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) and free to use. You can find
the source code on GitHub and use it without any licensing fees.

### Can I use ToolHive UI and the CLI together?

Yes, but ToolHive UI manages the CLI automatically. When you install ToolHive
UI, it creates a symlink to its bundled CLI and configures your PATH. You can
use the `thv` command from your terminal—it uses the UI-managed version.

If you have a standalone CLI installed separately (via Homebrew, WinGet, or
manually), it will conflict with the UI-managed version and show an error.
Uninstall the standalone version to resolve this.

For more information, see the [CLI access guide](./guides-ui/cli-access.mdx) and
[CLI conflict resolution](./guides-cli/install.mdx#cli-conflict-resolution).

## Using MCP servers

### How do I find available MCP servers?

ToolHive includes a curated registry of verified MCP servers. You can browse
them from the **Registry** tab in the UI or by running `thv registry list` in
the CLI.

### What MCP servers are available?

The registry includes servers for common use cases, such as retrieving content
from the web using the
[GoFetch MCP server](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/gofetch), and for popular
services and platforms like:

- **Atlassian** – Access Jira and Confluence
- **AWS Documentation** – Query AWS service documentation
- **GitHub** – Access repositories, issues, and pull requests
- **Kubernetes** – Interact with Kubernetes clusters via the
  [MKP MCP server](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/mkp)
- **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis** – Connect to databases
- **Notion** – Connect to Notion workspaces
- And many more

### Can I run MCP servers that aren't in the registry?

Yes. You can run any MCP server from a container image or source package, even
if it's not in the registry. Just provide the image name or package details when
starting the server using the CLI or UI. See the custom MCP server section in
the [UI guide](./guides-ui/run-mcp-servers.mdx#install-a-custom-mcp-server) and
[CLI guide](./guides-cli/run-mcp-servers.mdx#run-a-custom-mcp-server) for more
details.

The Kubernetes operator also supports custom MCP servers that are packaged as
container images.

:::tip

You can use the ToolHive CLI to run a custom MCP server from a source package
once, then export the Docker image for import into your container registry or
Kubernetes cluster to use it with the operator.

## Privacy and data collection

### Does ToolHive collect any data?

ToolHive collects anonymous usage metrics to help improve the product. These
metrics include only tool call counts and are completely anonymous. No personal
information, user identifiers, or sensitive data is collected.

The metrics collection:

- Is enabled by default
- Only tracks the number of tool calls
- Uses a randomly generated instance ID (not tied to your identity)
- Is automatically disabled in CI environments
- Can be easily disabled

### How do I disable usage metrics?

You can opt out of usage metrics collection in two ways:

**Option 1: Persistent configuration (recommended)**

Use the ToolHive CLI to disable metrics permanently:

```bash
thv config usage-metrics disable
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**

Set an environment variable to disable metrics for the current session:

```bash
export TOOLHIVE_USAGE_METRICS_ENABLED=false
```

Once you opt out, ToolHive stops collecting and sending usage metrics. You need
to restart any running servers for the change to take effect.

## Security and permissions

### Is it safe to run MCP servers?

ToolHive runs MCP servers in isolated containers with minimal default
permissions. Each server runs in its own container with restricted access to
your system and network.

:::tip

For extra security, review the permission profiles and network isolation options
before running new or untrusted MCP servers.

:::

### How does ToolHive handle secrets like API keys?

ToolHive provides secure secrets management:

- Secrets are encrypted and stored securely on your system
- They're passed to MCP servers as environment variables
- Secrets never appear in plaintext in configuration files
- Integration with 1Password is also supported

### Can I control what an MCP server can access?

Yes. ToolHive uses permission profiles to control:

- **File system access** – Which directories the server can read or write
- **Network access** – Which hosts and ports the server can connect to

You can use built-in profiles or create custom ones for specific security
requirements.

### What's network isolation and when should I use it?

Network isolation creates a secure network architecture that filters all
outbound connections from MCP servers. Use the `--isolate-network` flag when
running servers that need strict network controls, especially in enterprise
environments.

## Enterprise and advanced usage

### Can I use ToolHive in my company?

Yes. ToolHive is designed for both individual developers and enterprise teams.
The Kubernetes Operator provides centralized management, security controls, and
integration with existing infrastructure for enterprise deployments.

### How do I deploy ToolHive in Kubernetes?

Use the ToolHive Kubernetes Operator to deploy and manage MCP servers as
Kubernetes resources. See the [Kubernetes guides](./guides-k8s/index.mdx) for
detailed instructions. The Kubernetes operator is currently experimental.

### Can I run my own custom MCP servers?

Yes. You can run custom MCP servers from Docker images or source packages.
ToolHive supports:

- Docker images from public or private registries
- Source packages from package managers like npm, PyPI, or Go modules

### How do I get my MCP server added to the ToolHive registry?

The ToolHive registry has specific
[inclusion criteria](./concepts/registry-criteria.mdx), such as being open
source, following good security practices, and maintaining code quality. Review
the criteria and
[submit your server for consideration](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry/issues/new?template=add-an-mcp-server.md).

### Can I use ToolHive behind a corporate firewall?

Yes. ToolHive supports corporate environments with:

- Custom CA certificate configuration for TLS inspection
- Network isolation and permission profiles
- Integration with secret management systems like 1Password
