  How to create and apply file system permissions and network isolation for MCP
  servers using permission profiles in ToolHive.
---

ToolHive includes a permission system that lets you control an MCP server's
access to your host's file system and network resources. This is crucial for
maintaining security and ensuring that MCP servers operate within defined
boundaries.

## Understanding permission profiles

Permissions are defined using _permission profiles_—JSON files that specify both
file system and network access rules for an MCP server. Each MCP server can use
only one permission profile at a time, so you combine all necessary permissions
into a single profile.

Permission profiles control two types of access:

- **Host file system access** — see [file system access](./filesystem-access.md)
  for detailed examples
- **Network access rules** (outbound connections from the MCP server) — see
  [network isolation](./network-isolation.mdx) for network architecture details
  and examples

### Profile structure

Profiles are defined in JSON format and can include the following properties:

- `read`: List of paths on your host file system that the MCP server can read
- `write`: List of file system paths that the MCP server can write to (this also
  implies read access)
- `network`: Network access rules for outbound connections:
  - `outbound`: Outbound network access rules, which include:
    - `insecure_allow_all`: If set to `true`, allows unrestricted outbound
      network access. This isn't recommended for production use.
    - `allow_host`: List of allowed hostnames or IP addresses for outbound
      connections. To allow all subdomains of a domain, prefix the domain with a
      period (e.g., `.github.com` allows any subdomain of `github.com`).
      Wildcards are not supported.
    - `allow_port`: List of allowed ports for outbound connections

### Combining file system and network permissions

Since you can specify only one permission profile per MCP server, combine both
file system and network permissions in the same JSON file when needed:

```json
{
  "read": ["/path/to/data"],
  "write": ["/path/to/output"],
  "network": {
    "outbound": {
      "allow_host": ["api.example.com"],
      "allow_port": [443]
    }
  }
}
```

## Default permissions in the ToolHive registry

ToolHive includes default least-privilege permissions for MCP servers in the
built-in registry. These defaults are designed to balance functionality and
security, but you should review them to make sure they meet your specific
requirements.

View these permissions using the following command:

```bash
thv registry info <SERVER_NAME>
```

In the output, look for the "Permissions" section:

```test
Permissions:
  Network:
    Allow Host: .google.com
    Allow Port: 443
```

This example shows that the MCP server can make outbound network connections to
`*.google.com` (note the leading `.` which enables subdomain matching) on
port 443.

:::info

For security reasons, none of the MCP servers in the registry have any default
file system permissions defined. This means they cannot read or write to any
paths on your host system unless you explicitly grant access using a custom
permission profile or use the `--volume` flag when running the server.

:::

Always verify the default permissions and override them with a custom profile if
needed to meet your security policies.

:::tip

Add `--format json` to the
[`thv registry info`](../reference/cli/thv_registry_info.md) command to get the
output in JSON format for easier customization. Use the contents of the
`permissions` section as a starting point for creating a custom profile.

:::

## Built-in profiles

ToolHive includes two built-in profiles for network access that you can use
without creating a custom file:

- **`network`**: Permits all outbound network access. This is the default
  profile applied to MCP servers when you run a custom server without the
  `--permission-profile` flag.

  :::important

  This profile is useful for development and testing but isn't recommended for
  production use since it doesn't restrict network destinations. Create a custom
  profile that specifies the allowed hosts and ports when possible.

  :::

- **`none`**: Restricts all network access. Use this for MCP servers that don't
  require external connectivity.

Both built-in profiles provide no file system access by default. To add file
system permissions, either:

- Use the `--volume` flag to mount specific paths
- Create a custom profile that combines the network settings with file system
  permissions

## Create a custom permission profile

Create a JSON file with your desired permissions. You can include file system
permissions, network permissions, or both in the same profile.

### Example: Combined file system and network permissions

```json title="~/my-server-profile.json"
{
  "read": ["/home/user/documents", "/home/user/config"],
  "write": ["/home/user/output"],
  "network": {
    "outbound": {
      "insecure_allow_all": false,
      "allow_host": ["api.github.com", ".googleapis.com"],
      "allow_port": [443]
    }
  }
}
```

This profile:

- Allows read-only access to `/home/user/documents` and `/home/user/config`
- Allows read and write access to `/home/user/output` (note that `write` also
  implies read access)
- Allows outbound HTTPS connections to `api.github.com` and any subdomain of
  `googleapis.com`

### Example: Network-only permissions

```json title="~/network-only-profile.json"
{
  "network": {
    "outbound": {
      "allow_host": ["host.docker.internal", ".intranet.example.com"],
      "allow_port": [8080, 3000]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: File system-only permissions

```json title="~/filesystem-only-profile.json"
{
  "read": ["/var/log"],
  "write": ["/tmp/mcp-output"]
}
```

## Apply a permission profile

### Using a built-in profile

To run an MCP server with a built-in profile:

```bash
# This is equivalent to running a server without the --permission-profile flag
thv run --permission-profile network <SERVER>
```

or

```bash
thv run --permission-profile none <SERVER>
```

Add the `--isolate-network` flag to enforce network restrictions:

```bash
thv run --isolate-network --permission-profile none <SERVER>
```

### Using a custom profile file

To run an MCP server with your custom profile:

```bash
thv run --isolate-network --permission-profile </path/to/custom-profile.json> <SERVER>
```

## Security best practices

When creating and using permission profiles:

- Use the `none` profile when possible for MCP servers that don't require
  network or file access
- Only grant necessary permissions
- Avoid enabling `network.outbound.insecure_allow_all`, as this allows
  unrestricted outbound network access
- Review and test custom profiles thoroughly
- Keep permission profiles in version control to track changes and share them
  with your team
