## Introduction

The ToolHive CLI (`thv`) is a command-line tool that allows you to deploy and
manage MCP servers on your local machine or in development environments. It
provides quick deployment of MCP servers and supports advanced features like
custom permissions, network access filtering, and telemetry.

It's designed for developers who prefer working in a terminal or need to
integrate MCP server management into scripts or automation workflows.

:::tip[Did you know?]

The ToolHive CLI can be used alongside the
[ToolHive UI](../guides-ui/index.mdx), which provides a graphical interface. You
can use both tools together to get the best of both worlds: the ease of use of a
graphical interface and the flexibility of the CLI.
