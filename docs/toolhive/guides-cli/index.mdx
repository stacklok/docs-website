## Introduction

The ToolHive CLI (`thv`) is a command-line tool that allows you to deploy and
manage MCP servers on your local machine or in development environments. It
provides quick deployment of MCP servers and supports advanced features like
custom permissions, network access filtering, and telemetry.

It's designed for developers who prefer working in a terminal or need to
integrate MCP server management into scripts or automation workflows.

:::info[Using ToolHive UI?]

If you have the ToolHive UI installed, it automatically manages the CLI for you.
You don't need to install the CLI separately. See
[CLI and UI coexistence](./install.mdx#cli-and-ui-coexistence) for details.
