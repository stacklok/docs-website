This guide walks you through installing, upgrading, and managing the ToolHive
CLI ([`thv`](../reference/cli/thv.md)).

## Prerequisites

Before installing ToolHive, make sure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating systems**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Container runtime**: Docker or Podman

ToolHive requires minimal CPU, memory, and disk space. The exact requirements
depend on how many MCP servers you run and what resources they use.

## Install ToolHive

You can install ToolHive using several methods:

<Tabs groupId='installer' queryString='installer'>
<TabItem value='macos' label='Homebrew (macOS)' default>
If you use Homebrew on macOS, this is the easiest installation method:

```bash
brew tap stacklok/tap
brew install thv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='winget' label='WinGet (Windows)'>
WinGet is available by default on Windows, making this the easiest installation method:

```bash
winget install stacklok.thv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='binary' label='Pre-compiled binaries'>
1. Visit the [ToolHive releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/releases)

2. Download the appropriate binary for your platform:

   - `toolhive_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` for macOS (Intel)
   - `toolhive_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` for macOS (Apple Silicon)
   - `toolhive_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz` for Linux (x86_64)
   - `toolhive_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz` for Linux (ARM64)
   - `toolhive_<version>_windows_amd64.zip` for Windows (x86_64)
   - `toolhive_<version>_windows_arm64.zip` for Linux (ARM64)

3. Extract the archive and copy the binary to a directory in your PATH:

   macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf toolhive_<version>_<platform>.tar.gz
   sudo mv thv /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/thv
   ```

   On Windows, extract the ZIP file to a folder and add that folder to your PATH
   environment variable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='source' label='Build from source'>

#### Prerequisites for building from source

- Go 1.24 or newer
- Git
- Your `$GOPATH/bin` directory should be in your PATH

#### Using Task (recommended)

:::note

The Task scripts currently only support macOS and Linux. Windows users should
use the pre-compiled binaries or build from source using Go tools.

:::

If you have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive.git
   cd toolhive
   ```

2. Build and install the binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`:

   ```bash
   task install
   ```

#### Using Go tools

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive.git
   cd toolhive
   ```

2. Build and install the binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`:

   ```bash
   go install ./cmd/thv
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verify your installation

To verify that ToolHive is installed correctly:

```bash
thv version
```

You should see output showing the version number, build date, and Git commit:

```text title="ToolHive version output"
ToolHive v0.0.33
Commit: e8efa1b1d7b0776a39339257d30bf6c4a171f2b8
Built: 2025-05-12 14:31:06 UTC
Go version: go1.24.1
Platform: darwin/arm64
```

## Upgrade ToolHive

ToolHive automatically checks for updates and notifies you when a new version is
available. When you run a ToolHive command, it displays a message if an update
exists.

To upgrade ToolHive:

<Tabs groupId='installer' queryString='installer'>
<TabItem value='macos' label='Homebrew (macOS)' default>

If you installed ToolHive via Homebrew, upgrade it with:

```bash
brew upgrade thv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='winget' label='winget (Windows)'>

If you installed ToolHive via winget, upgrade it with:

```bash
winget upgrade stacklok.thv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='binary' label='Pre-compiled binaries'>

Follow the same steps as the [initial installation](#install-toolhive),
downloading the latest release and overwriting the previous binary.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='source' label='Build from source'>

If you built ToolHive from source, upgrade it by pulling the latest changes and
rebuilding:

#### Using Task:

```bash
git pull

task install
```

#### Using Go tools

```bash
git pull

go install ./cmd/thv
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get help with ToolHive commands

ToolHive has built-in help for all commands:

```bash
# General help
thv --help

# Help for a specific command
thv <command> --help
```

For detailed documentation on each command, see the
[CLI reference documentation](../reference/cli/thv.md).

## Enable shell completion

ToolHive can generate auto-completion scripts for your shell to make it easier
to use. The `thv completion` command generates scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and
PowerShell.

Each shell has different requirements for where to store completion scripts and
how to enable them. The help output for each shell provides specific
instructions:

```bash
# Get help on completion options
thv completion --help

# Get specific instructions for your shell
thv completion bash --help
thv completion zsh --help
thv completion fish --help
thv completion powershell --help
```

## Uninstall ToolHive

To uninstall ToolHive:

1. First, remove any MCP servers managed by ToolHive:

   ```bash
   # List running servers
   thv list
   # Stop and remove each server
   thv stop <server-name>
   thv rm <server-name>
   ```

2. Remove all ToolHive configuration and log files:

   ```bash
   # Remove the secrets encryption password entry from your OS keyring
   thv secret reset-keyring

   # Delete the ToolHive configuration and log files
   # macOS:
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/toolhive/
   # Linux:
   rm -rf ~/.config/toolhive/
   ```

3. Remove the ToolHive CLI:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
   <Tabs groupId='installer' queryString='installer'>
     <TabItem value='homebrew' label='Homebrew (macOS)' default>
       If you installed ToolHive via Homebrew, uninstall it with:

       ```bash
       brew uninstall thv
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value='winget' label='winget (Windows)'>
       If you installed ToolHive via winget, uninstall it with:

       ```bash
       winget uninstall stacklok.thv
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value='binary' label='Pre-compiled binaries'>
       Delete the binary from your PATH:

       ```bash
       sudo rm /usr/local/bin/thv
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value='source' label='Build from source'>
       Remove the binary from your `$GOPATH`:

       ```bash
       rm $(go env GOPATH)/bin/thv
       ```
     </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

## Next steps

Now that you have ToolHive installed, you can start using it to run and manage
MCP servers. See [Explore the registry](./registry.md) and
[Run MCP servers](run-mcp-servers.mdx) to get started.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied errors

If you see "permission denied" errors when running ToolHive:

1. Make sure the binary is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/thv
   ```

2. If using Docker on Linux, make sure your user has permission to access the
   Docker socket:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   (Log out and back in or run `newgrp docker` for this to take effect)

   See
   [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   for more details.
