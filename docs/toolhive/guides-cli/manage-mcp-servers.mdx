  How to monitor and manage the lifecycle of MCP servers using ToolHive.
---

## Monitoring

ToolHive provides visibility into the status of your MCP servers. You can check
the status of running servers and view their logs using the ToolHive CLI.

### List running servers

To see all currently running MCP servers:

```bash
thv list
```

This shows details about each running server, including its name, package
(container image), status, URL for connecting clients, group, and when it was
created.

To include stopped servers in the list:

```bash
thv list --all
```

### View server logs

#### Containerized servers

To view the logs of a running or stopped containerized MCP server, use the
[`thv logs`](../reference/cli/thv_logs.md) command. You can optionally follow
the logs with the `--follow` option, which shows the most recent log entries and
updates in real time.

```bash
thv logs <SERVER_NAME> [--follow]
```

#### Remote servers

The thv logs command only works with local containers. For remote MCP servers,
there’s no container to read logs from, so you’ll need to check the log files
directly in the ToolHive application directory. The path depends on your
platform:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/toolhive/logs/<SERVER_NAME>.log`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/toolhive/logs/<SERVER_NAME>.log`

The specific log file path is displayed when you start a server with
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md).

## Lifecycle management

MCP servers can be started, stopped, restarted, and removed using the ToolHive
CLI. The commands are similar to Docker commands, but they're designed to work
with the ToolHive CLI and MCP servers.

### Stop a server

To stop a running MCP server:

```bash
thv stop <SERVER_NAME>
```

This stops the server and the associated proxy process, removes the MCP server's
entry from your configured clients, but keeps the container for future use. For
remote servers, this terminates the proxy process but preserves the
configuration.

Add the `--group` flag to stop all servers in a specific group:

```bash
thv stop --group <GROUP_NAME>
```

Add the `--all` flag to stop all running servers.

### Restart a server

To restart a stopped MCP server and add it back to your configured clients:

```bash
thv restart <SERVER_NAME>
```

For remote servers, restarting will:

1. Recreate the proxy process
2. Re-establish connection to the remote server
3. Re-authenticate with the remote server (triggers new OAuth flow)

Add the `--group` flag to restart all servers in a specific group:

```bash
thv restart --group <GROUP_NAME>
```

### Remove a server

To remove an MCP server:

```bash
thv rm <SERVER_NAME>
```

This removes the container and cleans up the MCP server's entry in your
configured clients. If the server is still running, it will be stopped as part
of the removal. For remote servers, this removes the proxy process,
configuration, and stored authentication tokens.

Add the `--group` flag to remove all servers in a specific group:

```bash
thv rm --group <GROUP_NAME>
```

:::note

If you use `docker rm` to remove an MCP container that ToolHive created, it
won't clean up the MCP server's entry in your configured clients. Use
[`thv rm`](../reference/cli/thv_rm.md) to make sure the entry is removed.

:::

### Remote server authentication

Remote servers with OAuth authentication will automatically refresh tokens when
they expire during normal operation. However, restarting a remote server always
triggers a new OAuth authentication flow:

```bash
thv restart <REMOTE_SERVER_NAME>
```

This will always prompt for re-authentication, even if valid tokens exist.
