title: Expand transport compatibility with proxy stdio
description:
  How to use the thv proxy stdio command to enable Claude Desktop and other
  stdio-only clients to connect to MCP servers using SSE or HTTP transport.
---

## Overview

Claude Desktop and many other MCP clients only support MCP servers that
communicate via stdio transport. However, many popular MCP servers use
Server-Sent Events (SSE) or Streamable-HTTP transport protocols. This means that
out of the box, these clients cannot connect to those servers.

ToolHive overcomes this limitation with the `thv proxy stdio` command. This
command transforms servers using SSE or Streamable-HTTP into stdio-compatible
processes, immediately expanding the tools available to stdio-only clients like
Claude Desktop.

## How it works

The `thv proxy stdio` command wraps an existing MCP server—regardless of its
transport method—and exposes it as a stdio-compatible process. When you use this
command:

1. ToolHive continues to run the MCP server (for example, `osv`) in its
   container with its default transport (SSE, HTTP, or other).
2. The `thv proxy stdio` command sets up a stdio-level wrapper pointing to that
   existing server.
3. Tools exposed by this MCP are recognized in your client and are ready to be
   used.
4. Your client interacts with this wrapper just like any other stdio MCP server.
   The client has no idea whether the underlying server uses SSE or HTTP.

## Usage example

Here's how to configure an SSE-based MCP server to work with Claude Desktop.

First, run an MCP server with SSE transport:

```bash
thv run osv --transport sse --name osv
```

Then configure Claude Desktop to use the proxy stdio command. Update your Claude
Desktop configuration file (typically located at
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osv": {
      "command": "thv",
      "args": ["proxy", "stdio", "osv"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

The workload name you pass to `thv proxy stdio` (in this case, `osv`) must match
the name you used when running the server with `thv run`.

:::

After restarting Claude Desktop, the MCP server's tools will be available for
use, even though it uses SSE transport.
