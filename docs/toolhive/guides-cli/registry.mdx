description: How to use the built-in registry to find MCP servers.
---

ToolHive includes a built-in registry of MCP servers with verified
configurations that meet a
[minimum quality standard](../concepts/registry-criteria.mdx), allowing you to
discover and deploy high-quality tools effortlessly. Simply select one from the
list and run it securely with a single command.

## Find MCP servers

To list all MCP servers in the ToolHive registry, run:

```bash
thv registry list
```

This command displays a list of servers with their name, description, tier
(official or community), and the number of stars and downloads to help you
identify the most popular and useful servers.

Example output:

```text

```

You can also search by keyword to find servers related to a specific topic or
capability:

```bash
thv search <TERM>
```

For example, to locate servers related to GitHub:

```bash
thv search github
```

## View server details

To view detailed information about a specific MCP server, run:

```bash
thv registry info <SERVER_NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
thv registry info github
```

ToolHive provides the server's description, available tools, configuration
options, and other metadata.

By default, ToolHive displays the server's configuration in a human-readable
format. To view the configuration in JSON format, use the `--format` option:

```bash
thv registry info <SERVER_NAME> --format json
```

### Example output

```yaml {1,11,19,24} showLineNumbers

```

This information helps you understand the server's capabilities, requirements,
and security profile before running it.

- **Server name** (line 1): The server name to use with the
  [`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) command
- **Metadata** (lines 2-10): Details about the server, including the image name,
  description, status, transport method, repository URL, whether the server has
  SLSA provenance available for verification, and popularity
- **Tools list** (line 11): The list of tools this MCP server provides
- **Configuration** (line 19): Required and optional environment variables
  needed to run the server
- **Permissions** (line 24): The permission profile applied to the server,
  including file system and network access (see
  [Custom permissions](./custom-permissions.mdx))

## Use a custom registry

By default, ToolHive uses a built-in registry of verified MCP servers. You can
configure ToolHive to use a custom registry instead. This is useful for
organizations that want to maintain their own private registry of MCP servers.

ToolHive supports two types of custom registries:

- **File-based registries**: JSON files that follow the
  [ToolHive registry schema](../reference/registry-schema-toolhive.mdx)
- **API-based registries**: REST API endpoints that implement the
  [MCP Registry API specification](../guides-registry/index.mdx), which use the
  [upstream registry schema](../reference/registry-schema-upstream.mdx)

Once you configure a custom registry, ToolHive uses it for all commands that
interact with the registry, such as `thv registry list`, `thv registry info`,
and `thv run`.

### Set a remote registry

To configure ToolHive to use a remote registry, set the registry URL or API
endpoint:

```bash
thv config set-registry <URL>
```

The CLI automatically detects the registry type:

- URLs ending with `.json` are treated as static registry files
- Other URLs are probed to detect MCP Registry API endpoints, falling back to
  static files if the probe fails
- Local paths are treated as local registry files

Examples:

```bash
# Static registry file
thv config set-registry https://example.com/registry.json

# API endpoint
thv config set-registry https://registry.example.com
```

### Set a local registry file

To configure ToolHive to use a local registry file, set the file path:

```bash
thv config set-registry <PATH>
```

For example:

```bash
thv config set-registry /path/to/local-registry.json
```

### Check the current registry

To see which registry is currently configured:

```bash
thv config get-registry
```

This displays the configured registry URL, API endpoint, or file path. If no
custom registry is configured, this command indicates that the built-in registry
is being used.

### Revert to the built-in registry

To remove the custom registry configuration and revert to using the built-in
registry:

```bash
thv config unset-registry
```

This restores the default behavior of using ToolHive's built-in registry.

## Organize servers with registry groups

Registry groups allow you to organize related MCP servers and run them together
as a cohesive unit. This is particularly useful for creating team-specific
toolkits, workflow-based server collections, or environment-specific
configurations.

:::note

Registry groups are different from [runtime groups](./group-management.mdx).
Registry groups organize server definitions within registry files, while runtime
groups organize running server instances for access control.

:::

### Group structure

Groups are defined as a top-level array in your custom registry:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    // Individual servers
  },
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "group-name",
      "description": "Description of what this group provides",
      "servers": {
        "server-name": {
          // Complete server definition
        }
      },
      "remote_servers": {
        "remote-server-name": {
          // Complete remote server definition
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key characteristics

- **Optional**: Groups are entirely optional. Omit the `groups` section if you
  only need individual servers
- **Independent server definitions**: Each group contains complete server
  configurations, not references to top-level servers
- **Self-contained**: Groups can define servers with the same names as top-level
  servers but with different configurations
- **Flexible membership**: The same server can appear in multiple groups with
  different configurations

### Example: Multi-environment groups

Here's an example showing how groups can organize servers for different
purposes:

```json title='registry-with-groups.json'

              "description": "Heroku API key",
              "required": true,
              "secret": true
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "testing-suite",
      "description": "Servers needed for automated testing workflows",
      "servers": {
        "test-fetch": {
          "description": "Restricted fetch server for testing",
          "image": "ghcr.io/stackloklabs/gofetch/server:latest",
          "status": "Active",
          "tier": "Community",
          "transport": "streamable-http",
          "args": ["--timeout", "5s"],
          "permissions": {
            "network": {
              "outbound": {
                "allow_host": ["test.example.com"],
                "allow_port": [443]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This registry provides:

- A production-ready `production-fetch` server at the top level
- A `devops-toolkit` group with GitHub and Heroku servers for complete DevOps
  workflows
- A `testing-suite` group with a restricted `test-fetch` server

Notice how the `devops-toolkit` group contains multiple servers that work
together—GitHub for repository management and Heroku for
deployment—demonstrating how groups can bundle related functionality.

### Run registry groups

You can run entire groups using the group command:

```bash
# Run all servers in the devops-toolkit group (GitHub + Heroku)
thv group run devops-toolkit

# Run all servers in the testing-suite group
thv group run testing-suite

# You can also pass environment variables and secrets to specific servers in the group
thv group run devops-toolkit --secret github-token,target=github.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN --secret heroku-key,target=heroku.HEROKU_API_KEY
```

Groups provide a convenient way to start multiple related servers with a single
command.
