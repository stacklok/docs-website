This guide explains how to run Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using
ToolHive. It covers how to run servers from the ToolHive registry, customize
server settings, and run custom servers using Docker images or protocol schemes.

## Run a server from the registry

To run an MCP server from the [ToolHive registry](./registry.md), use the
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) command with the name of the server you
want to run. The server name is the same as its name in the registry.

```bash
thv run <server-name>
```

For example:

```bash
thv run fetch
```

:::info What's happening?

When you run an MCP server from the registry, ToolHive:

1. Pulls the image and launches a container using the configuration from the
   registry.
2. Launches an HTTP proxy on a random port to forward client requests to the
   container.
3. Labels the container so it can be tracked by ToolHive:
   ```yaml
   toolhive: true
   toolhive-name: <server-name>
   ```

:::

See [Running custom MCP servers](#run-a-custom-mcp-server) to run a server that
is not in the registry.

## Customize server settings

You might need to customize the behavior of an MCP server, such as changing the
port, mounting a local directory, or passing secrets. ToolHive provides several
options to customize the server's configuration when you run it.

For a complete list of options, run
[`thv run --help`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) or see the
[`thv run` command reference](../reference/cli/thv_run.md).

### Run a server with a custom name

By default, the container name matches the MCP server's name in the registry or
is automatically generated from the image name when you run a custom server. To
give your server instance a custom name, use the `--name` option:

```bash
thv run --name my-custom-name <server-name>
```

For example:

```bash
thv run --name my-fetch fetch
```

### Run a server with secrets

Many MCP servers require secrets or other configuration variables to function
correctly. ToolHive lets you pass these secrets as environment variables when
starting the server.

To pass a secret to an MCP server, use the `--secret` option:

```bash
thv run --secret <secret-name>,target=<env-var-name> <server-name>
```

The `target` parameter specifies the name of the environment variable in the MCP
server's container. This is useful for passing secrets like API tokens or other
sensitive information.

For example:

```bash
thv run --secret github,target=GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN github
```

See [Secrets management](secrets-management.mdx) to learn how to manage secrets
in ToolHive.

### Mount a local directory

To let an MCP server access files on your host machine, you can mount a local
directory into the container:

```bash
thv run --volume <host-path>:<container-path>[:ro] <server-name>
```

The optional `:ro` suffix makes the volume read-only in the container. This is
useful for sharing files without letting the MCP server modify them.

ToolHive automatically adds mounted paths to the MCP server's
[permission profile](./custom-permissions.mdx).

For example, to mount a local directory to the Filesystem MCP server:

```bash
thv run --volume ~/code/toolhive:/projects/toolhive filesystem
```

The filesystem server can now access the contents of `~/code/toolhive` as
`/projects/toolhive` in the container (the filesystem MCP server expects
directories to be mounted at `/projects` by default).

### Pass additional arguments

Some MCP servers require additional arguments to run correctly. You can pass
these arguments after the server name in the
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) command:

```bash
thv run <server-name> -- <additional-args>
```

For example, to run the `fetch` server with custom arguments:

```bash
thv run fetch -- --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
```

Check the MCP server's documentation for the required arguments.

### Run a server on a specific port

ToolHive creates a reverse proxy on a random port that forwards requests to the
container. To specify the port for an MCP server:

```bash
thv run --port <port-number> <server-name>
```

## Run a custom MCP server

To run an MCP server that isn't in the registry, you can use a
[Docker image](#run-a-server-from-a-docker-image) or a
[protocol scheme](#run-a-server-using-protocol-schemes) to dynamically build the
server.

ToolHive supports the following transport methods:

- **Standard I/O** (`stdio`), default:\
  ToolHive redirects SSE traffic from the client to the container's standard
  input and output. This acts as a secure proxy, ensuring that the container
  doesn't have direct access to the network or the host machine.

- **HTTP with SSE (server-sent events)** (`sse`):\
  ToolHive creates a reverse proxy that forwards requests to the container using
  the HTTP/SSE protocol.

- **Streamable HTTP** (`streamable-http`):\
  ToolHive creates a reverse proxy that forwards requests to the container using
  the Streamable HTTP protocol, which replaced SSE in the MCP specification as
  of the `2025-03-26` revision.

:::info

We are actively monitoring the adoption of the Streamable HTTP protocol across
the client ecosystem. Once we confirm that ToolHive's supported clients support
Streamable HTTP, we will make it the default proxy transport method for stdio
servers.

:::

### Run a server from a Docker image

To run an MCP server from a Docker image, specify the image name and tag in the
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) command. You can also specify a custom
name for the server instance, the transport method, and any additional arguments
required by the MCP server.

```bash
thv run [--name <friendly-name>] [--transport <stdio/sse/streamable-http>] <image-name:tag> -- <server-args>
```

For example, to run an MCP server from a Docker image named
`my-mcp-server-image` that uses the Streamable HTTP transport method and takes
additional arguments:

```bash
thv run --name my-mcp-server --transport streamable-http my-mcp-server-image:latest -- --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
```

Check your MCP server's documentation for the required arguments.

:::info What's happening?

When you run an MCP server from a Docker image, ToolHive:

1. Pulls the image (`my-mcp-server-image:latest`) and launches a container with
   the options and arguments you specified.
2. Launches an HTTP proxy on a random port (optionally, add
   `--port <port-number>` to specify the port).
3. Labels the container so it can be tracked by ToolHive:
   ```yaml
   toolhive: true
   toolhive-name: my-mcp-server
   ```
4. Sets up the specified `--transport` method (`stdio`, `sse`, or
   `streamable-http`).

:::

See [`thv run --help`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) for more options.

### Run a server using protocol schemes

ToolHive also supports running MCP servers directly from package managers. This
means you can launch MCP servers without building or publishing a Docker image,
and without installing language-specific build tools on your machine.

Currently, three protocol schemes are supported:

- `uvx://`: For Python-based MCP servers using the uv package manager
- `npx://`: For Node.js-based MCP servers using npm
- `go://`: For Go-based MCP servers

```bash
thv run <protocol>://<package-name>@<version>
```

You'll likely need to specify additional arguments like the transport method,
volumes, and environment variables. Check your MCP server's documentation and
see [`thv run --help`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) for more options.

:::info What's happening?

When you use a protocol scheme, ToolHive:

1. Detects the protocol scheme and extracts the package reference
2. Generates a Dockerfile based on the appropriate template
3. Builds a Docker image with the package installed
4. Runs the MCP server using the new image (see
   [Run a server from a Docker image](#run-a-server-from-a-docker-image) for
   details)

:::

#### Examples

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString='protocol'>
<TabItem value='uvx' label='Python (uvx)' default>

The `uvx://` protocol is used for Python-based MCP servers. The package name
must be a valid package in the [PyPI registry](https://pypi.org/). The
`@<version>` suffix is _optional_ and defaults to the latest version if omitted.

```bash
thv run --name aws-docs uvx://awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='npx' label='Node.js (npx)'>

The `npx://` protocol is used for Node.js-based MCP servers. The package name
must be a valid package in the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). The
`@<version>` suffix is _optional_ and defaults to the latest version if omitted.

```bash
thv run --name pulumi npx://@pulumi/mcp-server@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='go' label='Go'>

The `go://` protocol is used for Go-based MCP servers. The package name must be
a valid Go module repo URI referencing the `main` package. The `@<version>`
suffix is **required**.

```bash
thv run --name grafana go://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/cmd/mcp-grafana@latest
```

You can also run a local Go module by specifying the path to the module:

```bash
# Run from a relative path
thv run go://./cmd/my-mcp-server

# Run from the current directory
cd my-go-mcp-project
thv run go://.

# Run from an absolute path
thv run go:///path/to/my-go-project
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add a custom CA certificate

In corporate environments with TLS inspection or custom certificate authorities,
you may need to configure a CA certificate for ToolHive to use when building
containers from protocol schemes like `uvx://`, `npx://`, and `go://`.

ToolHive provides both global configuration and per-command options for CA
certificates.

#### Configure a global CA certificate

To set a CA certificate that ToolHive will use for all container builds:

```bash
thv config set-ca-cert /path/to/corporate-ca.crt
```

To view the currently configured CA certificate:

```bash
thv config get-ca-cert
```

To remove the CA certificate configuration:

```bash
thv config unset-ca-cert
```

#### Override CA certificate per command

You can override the global CA certificate configuration for a specific run
using the `--ca-cert` flag:

```bash
thv run --ca-cert /path/to/other-ca.crt uvx://some-package
```

This is useful when you need to use different CA certificates for different
servers or when testing with a specific certificate.

#### Priority order

ToolHive uses the following priority order for CA certificates:

1. Command-line flag (`--ca-cert`)
2. Global configuration (`thv config set-ca-cert`)
3. No custom CA certificate (default behavior)

For example:

```bash
# Set a global CA certificate
thv config set-ca-cert /path/to/corporate-ca.crt

# This uses the configured CA certificate
thv run uvx://some-package

# This overrides the configured CA certificate
thv run --ca-cert /path/to/special-ca.crt uvx://other-package
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server fails to start

If a server fails to start:

1. Check if Docker/Podman is running
2. Verify you have internet access to pull images
3. Check if the port is already in use
4. Look at the error message for specific issues

### Server starts but isn't accessible

If a server starts but isn't accessible:

1. Check the server logs:

   ```bash
   thv logs <server-name>
   ```

2. Verify the port isn't blocked by a firewall

3. Make sure clients are properly configured (see
   [Client configuration](client-configuration.md))

### Server crashes or exits unexpectedly

If a server crashes or exits unexpectedly:

1. List all MCP servers including stopped ones:

   ```bash
   thv list --all
   ```

2. Check the logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   thv logs <server-name>
   ```

3. Try running with a different permission profile:

   ```bash
   thv run --permission-profile network <server-name>
   ```

4. Check if the server requires any secrets or environment variables
