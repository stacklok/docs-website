MCP servers often need secrets like API tokens, connection strings, and other
sensitive parameters. ToolHive provides built-in secrets management features,
letting you manage these values securely without exposing them in plaintext
configuration files.

## Secrets providers

ToolHive supports multiple secrets providers to fit different security and
workflow requirements:

- `encrypted` - ToolHive encrypts secrets using a password stored in your
  operating system's keyring
- `1password` - ToolHive retrieves secrets from a 1Password vault

You can use only one provider at a time. To select your preferred provider, run:

```bash
thv secret setup
```

If you plan to use 1Password, first set up a 1Password service account and
obtain an API token. See the 1Password tab below for details.

<Tabs groupId='secrets-provider'>
  <TabItem value='encrypted' label='Encrypted' default>

When you select the `encrypted` provider, ToolHive prompts you to create an
encryption password that protects your secrets.

ToolHive stores this encryption password in your operating system's keyring
(Keychain Access on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, and dbus/Gnome Keyring
on Linux). This means you don't need to enter the password every time you use a
[`thv secret`](../reference/cli/thv_secret.md) command.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='1password' label='1Password'>

:::note

The 1Password provider is read-only. You can list and view secrets, but you
can't create or delete them through ToolHive. Secrets must already exist in your
1Password vault.

:::

To use 1Password as your secrets provider, set up a 1Password service account.
For detailed instructions, see the
[1Password documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started#create-a-service-account).

Next, set the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable to your service
account's API token (displayed during the service account creation process).
This token is required for all [`thv secret`](../reference/cli/thv_secret.md)
commands:

```bash
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token>
```

Then, run `thv secret setup` and select `1password` when prompted.

To reference a secret from 1Password, use the
[1Password secret reference](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax)
URI format:

```text
op://<vault-name>/<item-name>/[section-name/]<field-name>
```

For example, to retrieve the `password` field from the `github` item in the
`MCPVault` vault:

```bash
thv secret get op://MCPVault/github/password
```

Run [`thv secret list`](../reference/cli/thv_secret_list.md) to see all secrets
accessible to your service account, along with their URIs.

## Manage secrets

### Create or update a secret

The [`thv secret set`](../reference/cli/thv_secret_set.md) command lets you
create or update a secret in your secret store. You can set a secret
interactively by running:

```bash
thv secret set <secret-name>
```

ToolHive prompts you to enter the secret value, and the input remains hidden for
security.

Example:

```bash
thv secret set github
# Enter your GitHub personal access token when prompted
```

Alternatively, you can set a secret using standard input:

```bash
echo "MY_SECRET_VALUE" | thv secret set <secret-name>
```

:::tip Example

Create a secret named `github` and set its value to your GitHub authentication
token using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth token | thv secret set github
```

:::

### List and view secrets

To list the names of all secrets in your secret store without revealing their
values:

```bash
thv secret list
```

To decrypt and view a secret's value:

```bash
thv secret get <secret-name>
```

### Remove a secret

To delete a secret when it's no longer needed:

```bash
thv secret delete <secret-name>
```

### Reset your secret store

ToolHive doesn't currently support changing the encryption password. If you need
to reset your secret store, delete the encrypted secrets file and recreate your
secrets.

First, remove the encryption password from the keyring:

```bash
thv secret reset-keyring
```

Then, delete the encrypted secrets file:

<Tabs groupId='os'>
  <TabItem value='macos' label='macOS' default>
   
    ```bash
    rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/toolhive/secrets_encrypted
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='linux' label='Linux'>

    ```bash
    rm ~/.config/toolhive/secrets_encrypted
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

    ```powershell
    Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\toolhive\secrets_encrypted"
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The next time you run a `thv secret` command, ToolHive prompts you to create a
new encryption password and starts with a fresh secret store.

## Use secrets with MCP servers

ToolHive can securely pass secrets to an MCP server when you run it. This lets
the server access sensitive information without exposing it in plaintext.

To do this, use the `--secret` flag with the
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md) command. The secret value is injected
into the container as an environment variable.

```bash
thv run --secret <secret-name>,target=<ENV_VAR_NAME> <server-name>
```

Check the MCP server's documentation to find the expected environment variable
names. For example, the GitHub MCP server expects the GitHub token to be passed
as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

For MCP servers in the ToolHive registry, you can find the expected environment
variable names in the server's registry entry:

```bash
thv registry info <server-name>
```

### Example: GitHub API token

This example shows how to set up a GitHub authentication token and use it with
the GitHub MCP server:

1. Set the secret:

   ```bash
   thv secret set github
   # Enter your GitHub personal access token when prompted
   ```

2. Run the GitHub MCP server with the token:

   ```bash
   thv run --secret github,target=GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN github
   ```

The GitHub MCP server now has access to your GitHub token and can make
authenticated API requests.

### Example: Multiple secrets

You can provide multiple secrets to a server by using the `--secret` flag
multiple times:

```bash
thv run \
  --secret github,target=GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --secret openai,target=OPENAI_API_KEY \
  multi-api-server
```

### Example: 1Password secret

To use a secret from 1Password with an MCP server, set the
`OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable with your 1Password service
account API token and reference the secret using the `op://` URI format.

```bash
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token> thv run \
  --secret op://MCPVault/slackbot/token,target=SLACK_BOT_TOKEN \
  --secret op://MCPVault/slackbot/team_id,target=SLACK_TEAM_ID \
  slack
```

This command retrieves the `token` and `team_id` fields from the `slackbot` item
in the `MCPVault` vault and passes them to the `slack` MCP server as the
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_TEAM_ID` environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Keyring access issues</summary>

If you run into errors related to the system keyring:

1. Make sure your system's keyring service is running
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions
3. On some Linux systems, you might need to install additional packages:

   ```bash
   # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring

   # For Fedora/RHEL
   sudo dnf install gnome-keyring
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Secret not available to MCP server</summary>

If your MCP server can't access a secret:

1. Verify the secret exists:

   ```bash
   thv secret list
   ```

2. Verify the secret value:

   ```bash
   thv secret get <secret-name>
   ```

3. Check that you're using the correct secret name and target environment
   variable. Inspect the MCP server's expected environment variables in the
   registry:

   ```bash
   thv registry info <server-name>
   ```

4. Inspect the server logs for any errors:

   ```bash
   thv logs <server-name>
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Forgot encryption password</summary>

If the keyring entry is lost or corrupted and you forget your encryption
password, you won't be able to access your secrets. In this case, delete the
[encrypted secrets file](#reset-your-secret-store) and recreate your secrets.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Issues accessing 1Password secrets</summary>

If you can't access 1Password secrets:

1. Verify the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable is set:

   ```bash
   echo $OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
   ```

2. Check that the token is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the
   vault and item:

   ```bash
   thv secret list
   ```

3. Make sure the secret reference URI is correct and matches the vault, item,
   and field names in 1Password:

   ```bash
   thv secret get op://<vault-name>/<item-name>/[section-name/]<field-name>
   ```
