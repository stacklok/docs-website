ToolHive includes several commands to help you test and validate MCP servers.
These commands ensure that your servers are functioning correctly. This is
useful for:

- Validating new MCP server installations
- Troubleshooting existing MCP servers
- Testing custom MCP servers during development

## MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is an
interactive tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

You can quickly launch the MCP Inspector and connect it to an MCP server running
with ToolHive using the `thv inspector` command:

```bash
thv inspector <SERVER_NAME>
```

ToolHive downloads and runs the official Inspector container image and outputs
the URL to open it in your web browser with the target MCP server's details
pre-populated.

Example:

```bash
thv run fetch
thv inspector fetch
```

The output will look like this:

```text
2:52PM	INFO	Pulling image: ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector:0.17.0
2:52PM	INFO	Pull complete for image: ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector:0.17.0
2:52PM	INFO	Waiting for MCP Inspector to be ready...
2:52PM	INFO	Connected to MCP server: fetch
2:52PM	INFO	Inspector UI is now available at http://localhost:6274?transport=streamable-http&serverUrl=http://host.docker.internal:21309/mcp&MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=<RANDOM_TOKEN>
```

Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the MCP Inspector UI, where
you can interactively test the MCP server's tools, prompts, and resources.

## `thv mcp` commands

ToolHive also includes several
[`thv mcp` commands](../reference/cli/thv_mcp_list.md) to test and validate MCP
servers. You can list the MCP server's tools, prompts, and resources:

```bash
thv mcp list tools --server <SERVER_NAME_OR_URL>
thv mcp list prompts --server <SERVER_NAME_OR_URL>
thv mcp list resources --server <SERVER_NAME_OR_URL>
```

Replace `<SERVER_NAME_OR_URL>` with either the MCP server name or its ToolHive
proxy URL. You can find both values in the output of `thv list`.

Add the `--format json` flag to get the output in JSON format.

:::note

Currently, the `thv mcp` commands only support using server names for local MCP
servers. For remote servers, you must use the full URL instead of the server
name. You can track
[this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/issues/2035).

To use URLs instead of names, get the server URL from `thv list` and use it
directly, like `thv mcp list tools --server http://localhost:12345/mcp`.
