## Introduction

The ToolHive Kubernetes operator manages MCP servers in Kubernetes clusters. It
provides a way to deploy, manage, and scale MCP servers in multi-user
environments. By defining MCP servers as Kubernetes resources, the operator
automates their deployment and management, making it easier to run MCP servers
in multi-user environments.

:::info

Experimental The Kubernetes operator is still under active development and isn't
recommended for production use cases yet. Specifically, the `MCPServer` Custom
Resource Definition (CRD) is still in an alpha state so breaking changes to the
spec and its capabilities are possible.
