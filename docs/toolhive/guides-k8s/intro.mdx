The ToolHive Kubernetes operator manages MCP servers in Kubernetes clusters. It
lets you define MCP servers as Kubernetes resources and automates their
deployment and management.

:::info[Experimental]

The Kubernetes operator is still under active development and isn't recommended
for production use cases yet. Specifically, the `MCPServer` Custom Resource
Definition (CRD) is still in an alpha state so breaking changes to the spec and
its capabilities are possible.

See the [ToolHive Operator quickstart tutorial](../tutorials/quickstart-k8s.mdx)
to get started quickly using a local kind cluster. We'd love for you to try
itout and send feedback!

## Overview

The operator introduces a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD) called
`MCPServer` that represents an MCP server in Kubernetes. When you create an
`MCPServer` resource, the operator automatically:

1. Creates a Deployment to run the MCP server
2. Sets up a Service to expose the MCP server
3. Configures the appropriate permissions and settings
4. Manages the lifecycle of the MCP server

## Installation

[Use Helm to install the ToolHive operator](./deploy-operator-helm.mdx) in your
Kubernetes cluster. Helm simplifies the installation process and lets you manage
the operator using Helm charts.

Once the operator is installed, you can create and manage MCP servers using the
[`MCPServer` custom resource](./run-mcp-k8s.mdx).
