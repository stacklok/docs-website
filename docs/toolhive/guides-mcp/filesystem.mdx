## Overview

The
[Filesystem MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem)
provides access to the local filesystem, allowing AI agents to read and write
files as part of their workflows.

:::note

Since most AI agent host applications like IDEs already have access to your
working directory, this MCP server is primarily useful for access to files
outside your working directory, headless environments where the host application
does not provide filesystem access, or for demonstrating MCP capabilities.

:::

## Metadata

<MCPMetadata name='filesystem' />

## Usage

<Tabs groupId='mode' queryString='mode'>
<TabItem value='ui' label='UI' default>

Select the `filesystem` MCP server in the ToolHive registry.

In the **Storage volumes** section,
[add local files or folders](../guides-ui/run-mcp-servers.mdx#volumes) to expose
to the MCP server. In the drop-down, choose whether to mount the volume as
read-only or read-write.

:::note

By default, the server expects files to be located in `/projects`. If you use a
different container path, you must update the command arguments to replace
`/projects` with your custom path.

:::tip[Security tip]

Since the server does not require any network access,
[enable **network isolation**](../guides-ui/network-isolation.mdx) and do not
add any hosts or ports to completely restrict its outbound network access.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli' label='CLI'>

[Mount a directory](../guides-cli/filesystem-access.mdx) from the host
filesystem to the MCP server using the default container path:

```bash
thv run --volume /path/to/host/directory:/projects filesystem
```

:::note

By default, the server expects files to be located in `/projects`. If you use a
different container path, you must update the command arguments to replace
`/projects` with your custom path.

:::

Mount multiple files or directories by repeating the `--volume` flag. This
example mounts a directory under `/projects` and a file under `/data`, and
updates the command arguments accordingly:

```bash
thv run \
  --volume /path/to/host/directory1:/projects/dir1 \
  --volume /path/to/host/file.txt:/data/file.txt:ro \
  filesystem -- /projects /data
```

:::tip

Since the server does not require any network access, add the
`--isolate-network --permission-profile none` flags to completely restrict its
outbound network access (see the
[network isolation guide](../guides-cli/network-isolation.mdx)).

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='k8s' label='Kubernetes'>

Create a Kubernetes manifest to deploy the Filesystem MCP server with a
[persistent volume](../guides-k8s/run-mcp-k8s.mdx#mount-a-volume).

Update the `podTemplateSpec` section to include your specific volume claim and
mount path:

```yaml {17-20,23-26} title="filesystem.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: filesystem
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: mcp/filesystem:latest
  transport: stdio
  proxyPort: 8080
  args:
    - '/projects' # Update if you use a different mountPath below
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: my-mcp-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-mcp-data-claim
      containers:
        - name: mcp
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /projects/my-mcp-data
              name: my-mcp-data
              readOnly: true
```

:::note

If you change the mount path from `/projects`, you must also update the `args`
section to include the path.

:::

Apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f filesystem.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample prompts

Here are some sample prompts you can use to interact with the Filesystem MCP
server:

- "List all files in the `/projects` directory"
- "Read the contents of the file `/projects/example.txt`"
- "Write 'Hello, World!' to the file `/projects/hello.txt`"

## Recommended practices

- Mount only the directories or files required for your AI agent's tasks to
  minimize resource usage and improve performance.
- Use read-only mounts for directories or files that do not need to be modified
  by the AI agent to prevent accidental changes.
- Enable network isolation to restrict the server's outbound network access,
  since the filesystem MCP server does not require any network connectivity.
