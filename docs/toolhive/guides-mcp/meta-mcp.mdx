## Overview

The meta-mcp server acts as an intelligent intermediary between AI clients and
multiple MCP servers. It provides tool discovery, unified access to multiple MCP
servers through a single endpoint, and intelligent routing of requests to
appropriate MCP tools.

Key features include:

- **Tool discovery**: Uses hybrid search (semantic + keyword) to find the right
  tools for your tasks
- **Unified access**: Single endpoint to access all your MCP servers without
  managing multiple connections
- **Tool management**: Seamlessly manage large numbers of MCP tools across
  different servers
- **Intelligent routing**: Automatically routes requests to the appropriate MCP
  server based on tool requirements

## Metadata

<MCPMetadata name='meta-mcp' />

## Usage

<Tabs groupId='mode' queryString='mode'>

<TabItem value='ui' label='UI'>

The meta-mcp server uses ToolHive groups to function. While you need the
ToolHive UI to run meta-mcp, it doesn't support group management yet, so you'll
need to use the CLI for setup.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='cli' label='CLI' default>

:::info[Prerequisites]

You need both the ToolHive CLI and UI to use the meta-mcp server because it
depends on the UI's API server for tool discovery and management.

- ToolHive UI (version >= 0.6.0) must be running for setup
- ToolHive CLI (version >= 0.3.1)

The meta-mcp server should run in a
[dedicated group](../guides-cli/group-management.md) to keep client
configurations clean. Other MCP servers that you want to access through meta-mcp
should be in a separate group.

:::

**Step 1: Create a dedicated group and run meta-mcp**

```bash
# Create the meta group
thv group create meta

# Run meta-mcp in the dedicated group
thv run --group meta meta-mcp
```

**Step 2: Configure your AI client for the meta group**

```bash
# Register your AI client with the meta group
thv client setup

# Verify the configuration
thv client list-registered
```

**Step 3: Add MCP servers to the default group**

```bash
# Add MCP servers that you want to access through meta-mcp
thv run github
thv run filesystem
thv run time

# Verify the configuration - meta-mcp should be in 'meta' group, others in 'default'
thv list
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample prompts

Once meta-mcp is configured and running, you can use it with natural language
prompts. The server automatically discovers and routes to appropriate tools:

**Direct task examples:**

- "Get the details of GitHub issue 1911 from stacklok/toolhive repo"
- "List recent PRs from stacklok/toolhive repo"

**The meta-mcp workflow:**

1. Your AI client sends the request to meta-mcp
2. Meta-mcp uses hybrid search (semantic + keyword) to find relevant tools
   across all connected MCP servers
3. Meta-mcp server returns the short list of matching tools to the client
4. Client selects one tool from the short list and uses meta-mcp to call that
   tool
5. Results are returned from meta-mcp to the client

## Available tools

The meta-mcp server provides two main tools:

### find_tool

Discovers available tools that match your requirements using hybrid search
(semantic + keyword).

**Parameters:**

- `tool_description`: Description of the task or capability needed (e.g., "web
  search", "analyze CSV file")
- `tool_keywords`: Space-separated keywords of the task or capability needed
  (e.g., "list issues github", "SQL query postgres")

### call_tool

Executes a specific tool with provided parameters after discovery.

**Parameters:**

- `server_name`: Name of the MCP server providing the tool
- `tool_name`: Name of the tool to execute
- `parameters`: Dictionary of arguments required by the tool

## Recommended practices

- **Use descriptive group names**: Keep meta-mcp in a dedicated group to
  maintain clean client configurations
- **Regular updates**: Keep both ToolHive and meta-mcp updated for the latest
  features and compatibility

:::tip[Best Practice]

Start with a small set of MCP servers in the default group and gradually add
more as you become familiar with meta-mcp's tool discovery capabilities. This
makes it easier to understand which tools are being used for different tasks.
