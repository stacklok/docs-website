## Overview

The official [Notion remote MCP server](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp)
provides access to your Notion workspace through the Notion API, allowing AI
agents to search, read, create, and manage pages, databases, and other content
in your Notion workspace.

This is a remote MCP server that uses OAuth authentication with dynamic client
registration, meaning ToolHive handles all authentication setup automatically
with minimal configuration required.

## Metadata

<MCPMetadata name='notion-remote' />

## Usage

<Tabs groupId='mode' queryString='mode'>
<TabItem value='ui' label='UI' default>

Select the `notion-remote` MCP server in the ToolHive registry.

The server is preconfigured with the following settings:

- **Server URL**: `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP
- **Authorization method**: Dynamic Client Registration

In the **Callback port** field, enter the port that ToolHive should use to
listen for the OAuth callback. This can be any available port on your machine.

When you install the server, ToolHive:

1. Discovers the OAuth endpoints automatically
2. Registers a new OAuth client with Notion
3. Opens your browser for authentication

After you authorize access in your browser, the remote MCP server appears in
your server list with a "Running" status.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli' label='CLI'>

Run the Notion remote MCP server with the default configuration:

```bash
thv run notion-remote
```

When you run the server, ToolHive:

1. Discovers the OAuth endpoints automatically
2. Registers a new OAuth client with Notion
3. Opens your browser for authentication

Customize the OAuth callback port if the default port (`8777`) is unavailable:

```bash
thv run --remote-auth-callback-port 50051 notion-remote
```

After successful authentication, the server will be available to your configured
MCP clients.

To restart the server (which triggers a new OAuth authentication flow):

```bash
thv restart notion-remote
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='k8s' label='Kubernetes'>

:::note

The ToolHive Kubernetes operator does not currently support remote MCP servers.
Instead, you can run the
[local Notion MCP server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) in
Kubernetes using a static integration key.

:::

Create an integration in Notion to obtain an authentication token by following
the instructions in the MCP server's
[README](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Create a Kubernetes secret containing your Notion integration token
("`ntn_****`"):

```bash
kubectl -n toolhive-system create secret generic notion-token --from-literal=token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

Create a Kubernetes manifest to deploy the Notion MCP server using your secret:

```yaml {14-17} title="notion.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: notion
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/notion:1.9.0
  transport: stdio
  port: 8080
  permissionProfile:
    type: builtin
    name: network
  secrets:
    - name: notion-token
      key: token
      targetEnvName: NOTION_TOKEN
```

Apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f notion.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample prompts

Here are some sample prompts you can use to interact with the Notion MCP server:

- "Search my Notion workspace for pages about 'project planning'"
- "Create a new page in my Notion workspace titled 'Meeting Notes' with today's
  date"
- "Find all database entries in my Task List database where status is 'To Do'"
- "Update the page titled 'Weekly Report' with a summary of this week's
  accomplishments"
- "List all pages in my 'Engineering' teamspace"
- "Create a new Notion database for tracking customer feedback with columns for
  name, date, and feedback text"
- "Add a comment to the page titled 'Q4 Planning' with my feedback"
- "Search for pages created by john@example.com in the last 30 days"

## Recommended practices

- **Scope your access**: When authenticating, review the permissions requested
  and only grant access to the workspaces you need for your use case.
- **Test with read operations**: Start with search and fetch operations to
  familiarize yourself with the server's capabilities before making changes to
  your workspace.
- **Use specific searches**: Instead of broad workspace searches, narrow down
  results by searching within specific pages, databases, or teamspaces for
  better performance.
- **Understand the data model**: Notion has a specific hierarchy (workspaces,
  teamspaces, pages, databases, data sources). Understanding this structure
  helps craft more effective prompts.
- **Be cautious with updates**: The MCP server can modify and delete content in
  your Notion workspace. Always review changes before applying them to important
  pages or databases.
- **Handle authentication errors**: If you see authentication errors, restart
  the server to trigger a new OAuth flow: `thv restart notion-remote`

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>OAuth authentication fails</summary>

If OAuth authentication fails or times out:

1. Ensure the callback port is not blocked by a firewall
2. Check that your browser allows pop-ups from ToolHive
3. Try restarting the server with `thv restart notion-remote`

</details>
<details>
<summary>Server shows "Running" but tools don't work</summary>

The server may have lost authentication. Restart the server to re-authenticate:

```bash
thv restart notion-remote
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Can't find content in search results</summary>

- Notion search uses semantic search, which may return different results than
  exact keyword matching
- Try using more specific search terms or filtering by page, database, or
  teamspace
- Check that you have access to the content you're searching for (permissions
  may limit results)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Rate limits</summary>

Notion's API has rate limits. If you encounter rate limit errors:

- Reduce the frequency of requests
- Use more specific queries to reduce the amount of data retrieved
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (typically a few minutes)
