## Overview

The [OSV MCP server](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/osv-mcp) provides access to
the [Open Source Vulnerabilities database](https://osv.dev), which aggregates
vulnerability data from multiple sources including GitHub Security Advisories,
PyPA, RustSec, and many others. This server enables AI agents to:

- Query vulnerabilities for specific package versions or Git commits
- Perform batch vulnerability queries across multiple packages
- Retrieve detailed vulnerability information by OSV ID
- Access comprehensive vulnerability data including severity, affected versions,
  and remediation guidance

The server supports various package ecosystems including npm, PyPI, Go modules,
Maven, NuGet, and more, making it an essential tool for security analysis and
dependency management workflows.

## Metadata

<MCPMetadata name='osv' />

## Usage

<Tabs groupId='mode' queryString='mode'>
<TabItem value='ui' label='UI' default>

Select the `osv` MCP server in the ToolHive registry.

The OSV MCP server does not require any additional configuration or secrets. It
communicates directly with the public OSV API at `api.osv.dev`.

:::tip[Security tip]

Enable outbound network filtering on the **Network Isolation** tab to restrict
the server's network access using the default profile contained in the registry.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli' label='CLI'>

Run with the default configuration:

```bash
thv run osv
```

Enable [network isolation](../guides-cli/network-isolation.mdx) using the
default profile from the registry to restrict the server's network access to
only the OSV API:

```bash
thv run --isolate-network osv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='k8s' label='Kubernetes'>

Create a Kubernetes manifest to deploy the OSV MCP server:

```yaml title="osv.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: osv
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/stackloklabs/osv-mcp/server:0.1.0
  transport: streamable-http
  mcpPort: 8080
  proxyPort: 8080
```

Apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f osv.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample prompts

Here are some sample prompts you can use to interact with the OSV MCP server:

- "Check if the npm package lodash version 4.17.15 has any known
  vulnerabilities"
- "Query vulnerabilities for the Python package jinja2 version 2.4.1 and the Go
  module github.com/gin-gonic/gin version 1.6.3"
- "Get detailed information about vulnerability GHSA-vqj2-4v8m-8vrq including
  affected versions and remediation steps"
- "Check for vulnerabilities in commit hash
  6879efc2c1596d11a6a6ad296f80063b558d5e0f"
- "Scan these packages for vulnerabilities: express@4.17.1, react@16.13.0, and
  django@3.0.5"
- "Look up vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 and provide details about affected
  packages and severity"

## Recommended practices

- **Use batch queries** when checking multiple packages to reduce API calls and
  improve performance. The batch query tool can handle multiple packages in a
  single request.
- **Enable network isolation** to restrict the server's network access to only
  the OSV API endpoints, improving security posture.
- **Specify ecosystems accurately** (npm, PyPI, Go, Maven, etc.) to ensure
  accurate vulnerability matching and reduce false positives.
- **Use package URLs (PURLs)** when available for more precise package
  identification across different ecosystems and registries.
- **Monitor rate limits** when performing large-scale vulnerability scans to
  avoid overwhelming the OSV API service.
