## Overview

The official
[Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) provides
browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This
server enables AI agents to interact with web pages through structured
accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned
models.

Key features include:

- **Fast and lightweight**: Uses Playwright's accessibility tree instead of
  pixel-based input
- **LLM-friendly**: Operates purely on structured data without requiring vision
  models
- **Deterministic tool application**: Avoids ambiguity common with
  screenshot-based approaches
- **Multi-browser support**: Works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari (WebKit), and
  Edge
- **Tab management**: Create, switch between, and manage multiple browser tabs
- **Persistent sessions**: Maintains login state and browser data between
  interactions

## Metadata

<MCPMetadata name='playwright' />

## Usage

The Playwright MCP server supports numerous command-line arguments to customize
its behavior. Common options include:

- **Custom viewport**: Set `--viewport-size` to specify browser dimensions
  (e.g., `1920,1080`)
- **Device emulation**: Use `--device` to emulate mobile devices (e.g.,
  `"iPhone 15"`)
- **Network isolation**: Configure `--allowed-origins` and `--blocked-origins`
  to control which websites the browser can access
- **Output directory**: Specify `--output-dir` to save screenshots, PDFs, and
  other files to a custom location; mount a host directory for persistence (see
  examples below)

Refer to the
[Playwright MCP server documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration)
for the full list of configuration options and their descriptions.

:::note[Limitations]

The containerized version of Playwright only supports the Chromium browser in
headless mode.

Select the `playwright` MCP server in the ToolHive registry. The server runs
with default settings that work for most use cases.

To customize the server's behavior, add command-line arguments in the **Command
arguments** section.

To save browser output files like screenshots and traces, mount a host directory
in the **Storage volumes** section and add the `--output-dir <container-path>`
command argument as shown in the screenshot below.

  }}

:::note[Important]

Don't remove the `--port 8931` argument, as the server requires it to function
correctly in ToolHive.

<TabItem value='cli' label='CLI'>

Run with the default configuration using Chromium in headless mode:

```bash
thv run playwright
```

Emulate a mobile device for responsive testing:

```bash
thv run playwright -- --port 8931 --device "iPhone 15"
```

Restrict access to specific domains:

```bash
thv run playwright -- --port 8931 --allowed-origins "example.com;trusted-site.com"
```

Mount a host directory (e.g., `~/playwright-output`) to save browser output
files like screenshots and traces:

```bash
mkdir ~/playwright-output
thv run --volume ~/playwright-output:/browser-output playwright -- --port 8931 --output-dir /browser-output --save-trace --save-session
```

You can run multiple instances of the server with different configurations by
giving each a unique name:

```bash
thv run --name playwright-desktop playwright -- --port 8931 --device "Desktop Chrome" --viewport-size 1920,1080
thv run --name playwright-iphone playwright -- --port 8931 --device "iPhone 15"
```

Don't remove the `--port 8931` argument, as the server requires it to function
correctly in ToolHive.

Create a basic Kubernetes manifest to deploy the Playwright MCP server:

```yaml title="playwright.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: playwright
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp:v0.0.36
  transport: streamable-http
  targetPort: 8931
  port: 8080
  args:
    - '--port'
    - '8931'
  permissionProfile:
    type: builtin
    name: network
```

Apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f playwright.yaml
```

For production deployments with network restrictions:

```yaml title="playwright-restricted.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: playwright
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp:v0.0.36
  transport: streamable-http
  targetPort: 8931
  port: 8080
  args:
    - '--port'
    - '8931'
    - '--allowed-origins'
    - 'example.com;trusted-domain.org'
  permissionProfile:
    type: builtin
    name: network
```

Mount a persistent volume to save browser output files like screenshots and
traces:

```yaml {13-14,22-25,28-31} title="playwright-with-volume.yaml"
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: playwright
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp:v0.0.36
  transport: streamable-http
  targetPort: 8931
  port: 8080
  args:
    - '--port'
    - '8931'
    - '--output-dir'
    - '/browser-output'
    - '--save-trace'
    - '--save-session'
  permissionProfile:
    type: builtin
    name: network
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: playwright-output
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: playwright-output-claim
      containers:
        - name: mcp
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /browser-output
              name: playwright-output
              readOnly: false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample prompts

Here are some sample prompts you can use to interact with the Playwright MCP
server:

- "Navigate to https://example.com and take a screenshot of the homepage"
- "Go to the login page, fill in the username field with 'testuser' and password
  field with 'password123', then click the login button"
- "Open https://news.ycombinator.com and get the titles of the top 5 stories"
- "Navigate to a form on https://httpbin.org/forms/post, fill it out with sample
  data, and submit it"
- "Go to https://github.com/microsoft/playwright and check if there are any
  console errors on the page"
- "Take a full-page screenshot of https://example.com and save it as
  'homepage.png'"
- "Navigate to an e-commerce site, search for 'laptop', and capture information
  about the first product"
- "Open multiple tabs, navigate to different websites in each, and then switch
  between them"

## Recommended practices

- **Use accessibility-first interactions**: The server works best when you
  describe elements by their accessible names, labels, or text content rather
  than visual characteristics.
- **Leverage browser profiles**: For workflows requiring authentication, use
  persistent profiles or storage state files to maintain login sessions.
- **Enable network restrictions**: Use `--allowed-origins` and
  `--blocked-origins` to limit which domains the browser can access, especially
  in production environments.
- **Monitor resource usage**: Browser automation can be resource-intensive;
  consider using headless mode and limiting concurrent sessions.
- **Handle dynamic content**: Use the `browser_wait_for` tool when dealing with
  content that loads asynchronously.
- **Organize output files**: Specify a custom output directory to keep
  screenshots, PDFs, and traces organized.
- **Test responsively**: Use device emulation to test how web applications
  behave on different screen sizes and devices.
