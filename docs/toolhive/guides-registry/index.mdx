## Introduction

The ToolHive Registry API server implements the official
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) Registry API specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap#registry).
It provides a standardized REST API for discovering and accessing MCP servers
from multiple backend sources, including Kubernetes clusters, Git repositories,
API endpoints, and local files.
