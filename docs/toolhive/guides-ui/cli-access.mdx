title: Access the CLI from ToolHive UI
description:
  How to use the ToolHive CLI when using the ToolHive UI application for
  advanced features and terminal-based workflows.
---

ToolHive UI includes the CLI for advanced users who want terminal access or
features not yet available in the graphical interface. ToolHive UI automatically
installs and manages the CLI, so you don't need to install it separately.

## Why use the CLI with ToolHive UI?

While the ToolHive UI covers most common tasks, you might want to use the CLI
for:

- **Advanced features**: Some features are available in the CLI before they're
  added to the graphical interface
- **Scripting and automation**: Integrate MCP server management into local
  scripts or automated workflows
- **Personal preference**: If you prefer working in a terminal for certain
  tasks, the CLI is available without a separate installation

## Use CLI commands

After ToolHive UI installation, you can use the CLI from your terminal:

1. Open a new terminal window to pick up the PATH changes.

1. Verify the CLI is available:

   ```bash
   thv version
   ```

1. Run any CLI command:

   ```bash
   thv list              # List running MCP servers
   thv registry list     # Browse available servers
   thv --help            # View all commands
   ```

For detailed command reference, see the [CLI guides](../guides-cli/index.mdx)
and [command reference](../reference/cli/thv.md).

## How ToolHive UI manages the CLI

When you install ToolHive UI, it automatically:

1. **Creates a symlink** to its bundled CLI binary:
   - macOS/Linux: `~/.toolhive/bin/thv`
   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ToolHive\bin\thv.exe`

1. **Configures your PATH** by adding entries to your shell configuration files
   (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `config.fish`, or the Windows User PATH)

This ensures the CLI version always matches the ToolHive UI version, preventing
compatibility issues with the API.

:::note

If you have a standalone CLI installed (via Homebrew, WinGet, or manually), it
will show a conflict error. See
[CLI conflict resolution](../guides-cli/install.mdx#cli-conflict-resolution) for
details.

## The Settings > CLI page

ToolHive UI includes a dedicated settings page to manage the CLI installation.
Access it from **Settings** (gear icon) > **CLI**.

The page displays:

- CLI installation status and version
- Symlink location and target path
- Shell configuration status

Use the **Reinstall** button if the CLI becomes unavailable or the symlink
breaks (for example, after moving the ToolHive UI application).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>CLI not found in terminal</summary>

If `thv` is not recognized after installing ToolHive UI:

1. **Open a new terminal window**: The PATH changes only take effect in new
   terminal sessions.

1. **Check the Settings > CLI page**: Verify that the PATH Configuration shows
   "Valid" status.

1. **Manually source your shell configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Bash
   source ~/.bashrc

   # Zsh
   source ~/.zshrc

   # Fish
   source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```

1. **Reinstall the CLI**: Go to Settings > CLI and click **Reinstall**.

<details>
<summary>Broken symlink after moving ToolHive UI</summary>

If you move the ToolHive UI application to a different location, the CLI symlink
may break. To fix this:

1. Open ToolHive UI from its new location.
1. Go to Settings > CLI.
1. Click **Reinstall** to create a new symlink pointing to the correct location.

<details>
<summary>CLI conflict error when running thv</summary>

If you see "CLI conflict detected", you have both ToolHive UI and a standalone
CLI installed. See
[CLI conflict resolution](../guides-cli/install.mdx#cli-conflict-resolution) for
the error message and resolution steps.
