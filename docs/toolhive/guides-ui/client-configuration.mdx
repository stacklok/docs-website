## Manage client connections

ToolHive automatically discovers supported AI clients that are installed on your
system. These are displayed on the **Clients** page. This discovery is dynamic:
if you install a new client, ToolHive automatically updates the list.

### Connect a client

To connect a client to ToolHive, toggle the switch under the client's name.

When you connect a client, ToolHive automatically configures it to use your
currently running MCP servers. Any new servers you start are also added.

When you stop or remove an MCP server, ToolHive updates the client's
configuration to remove the server.

### Disconnect a client

When you disconnect a client, ToolHive removes all MCP server configurations
from the client. The client will no longer be able to use any ToolHive-managed
MCP servers.

## Why don't I see my client?

If you don't see your client listed, ToolHive might not support it, or its
configuration file might not be in a location ToolHive recognizes.

For a list of supported clients and how ToolHive detects them, see the
[client compatibility reference](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx).

## Why do I still see a client I uninstalled?

Many clients leave behind configuration files even after you uninstall them.
ToolHive detects these files and continues to show the client in the UI. If you
want to remove the client from ToolHive, delete its configuration files
manually.

## Manual client configuration

For clients that ToolHive doesn't support directly, you can still configure them
to connect to ToolHive-managed MCP servers using the SSE (Server-Sent Events) or
Streamable HTTP protocol.

To do this, you need the URL of the MCP server you want to connect to. You can
get this URL from the **MCP Servers** page in ToolHive. Click the menu (ï¸™) on
the MCP server card to copy the URL.

You can then configure your client to use this URL. The exact steps depend on
your client or library, so refer to its documentation for details. See the
[client configuration reference](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx#manual-configuration)
for some common examples.
