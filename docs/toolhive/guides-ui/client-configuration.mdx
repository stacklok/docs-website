## Manage clients

ToolHive automatically discovers supported AI clients installed on your system.
To choose which clients ToolHive configures, open the **MCP Servers** page and
click **Manage Clients**. This opens a dialog that lists detected clients with
on/off toggles. Discovery is dynamic: if you install a new client, ToolHive
updates the list.

:::tip[Using groups?]

If you organize your MCP servers into groups, you can configure client access
per group. This lets you control which servers each client can access. See
[Organize servers with groups](./group-management.mdx) for details.

### Connect a client

To connect a client to ToolHive:

1. Go to **MCP Servers** and click **Manage Clients**.
2. Turn on the toggle for the client you want to connect.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

When you connect a client and save, ToolHive configures it to use your running
MCP servers. Any new servers you start are also added automatically. When you
stop or remove an MCP server, ToolHive updates the client's configuration to
remove the server.

### Disconnect a client

To disconnect, open **Manage Clients**, turn off the client's toggle, then click
**Save**. ToolHive removes the MCP server configurations from that client. The
client can no longer use ToolHive-managed MCP servers.

### Save your changes

Changes you make in **Manage Clients** are not applied until you click **Save**.
If you close the dialog or click **Cancel** without saving, your toggle changes
are discarded.

## Why don't I see my client?

If you don't see your client in **Manage Clients**, ToolHive might not support
it, or its configuration file might not be in a location ToolHive recognizes.

For a list of supported clients and how ToolHive detects them, see the
[client compatibility reference](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx).

## Why do I still see a client I uninstalled?

Many clients leave behind configuration files even after you uninstall them.
ToolHive detects these files and continues to show the client in the **Manage
Clients** dialog. If you want to remove the client from ToolHive, delete its
configuration files manually.

## Manual client configuration

For clients that ToolHive doesn't support directly, you can still configure them
to connect to ToolHive-managed MCP servers using the SSE (Server-Sent Events) or
Streamable HTTP protocol.

To do this, you need the URL of the MCP server you want to connect to. You can
get this URL from the **MCP Servers** page in ToolHive. Click the menu (ï¸™) on
the MCP server card to copy the URL.

You can then configure your client to use this URL. The exact steps depend on
your client or library, so refer to its documentation for details. See the
[client configuration reference](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx#manual-configuration)
for some common examples.
