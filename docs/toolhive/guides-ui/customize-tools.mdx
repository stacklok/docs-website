  Select which tools from an MCP server are available to your AI clients using
  the ToolHive UI.
---

ToolHive lets you customize which tools from a running MCP server are available
to your AI clients. You can enable or disable individual tools, and customize
their names and descriptions. This gives you fine-grained control over the
capabilities exposed by each server, helping you create focused tool sets and
reduce complexity for your AI workflows.

## Why customize tools?

Customizing tools helps you:

- **Reduce complexity**: Hide tools that aren't relevant to your workflow,
  making it easier for AI clients to select the right tool
- **Improve performance**: Fewer tools mean faster tool selection and reduced
  token usage in AI interactions
- **Enhance security**: Limit exposure to only the tools you need, reducing the
  risk of unintended actions
- **Create focused environments**: Tailor tool availability to specific tasks or
  projects
- **Clarify tool purpose**: Edit tool names and descriptions to make them more
  understandable for your specific use case

:::info[Registry match required]

Tool customization is only available for MCP servers that match an entry in the
registry. This includes:

- Servers installed directly from the registry
- Custom servers with a docker image or URL that matches a registry entry

Custom servers that don't match any registry entry do not support this feature.

:::

## Access tool customization

To customize tools for a running MCP server:

1. Open the **MCP Servers** page.
1. Find the server you want to customize and click the menu (︙) on its card.
1. Select **Customize Tools** from the dropdown menu.

The customize tools page displays all available tools from the MCP server, each
with a toggle switch and description.

:::note[Server must be running]

The MCP server must be running to view and customize tools. If the server is
stopped when you access the customize tools page, you'll see a message prompting
you to start the server first.

:::

## Enable or disable tools

On the customize tools page:

1. Review the list of available tools and their descriptions.
1. Use the toggle switches to enable or disable individual tools:
   - **Green (enabled)**: The tool is available to AI clients
   - **Gray (disabled)**: The tool is hidden from AI clients
1. Click **Apply** to save your changes.

The ToolHive proxy filters out disabled tools when AI clients connect to the
server. Clients only see and can only call the tools you've enabled.

:::warning[At least one tool required]

You must keep at least one tool enabled. ToolHive prevents you from disabling
all tools on a server, as this would make the server non-functional.

:::

## Edit tool names and descriptions

You can customize the name and description of any tool to make it more suitable
for your workflow. This is useful when the default tool name or description is
unclear, or when you want to adapt the tool's presentation to your specific use
case.

To edit a tool:

1. On the customize tools page, find the tool you want to edit.
1. Click the **Edit** button next to the tool.
1. In the dialog that opens:
   - Edit the **Tool** field to change the tool's name.
   - Edit the **Description** field to customize the tool's description.
   - The original values are shown as helper text for reference.
   - Leave either field empty to reset it to the original value.
1. Click **Save** to apply your changes, or **Cancel** to discard them.

Tools with custom names or descriptions are marked with a wrench icon to
indicate they have custom overrides applied. The icon color indicates the
status:

- **Orange**: The tool has unsaved custom overrides
- **Primary color**: The tool has saved custom overrides

Your customizations are preserved even if you disable and re-enable the tool.

:::tip[Unsaved custom overrides]

If you customize a tool's name or description but haven't clicked **Apply** on
the main page, a tooltip appears indicating "This tool has unsaved custom
overrides". Click **Apply** to save both your tool selection changes and custom
overrides.

:::

## How filtering works

When you customize tools:

1. You toggle tools on or off using the switches and optionally edit their names
   and descriptions.
1. After clicking **Apply**, your settings are saved to the server
   configuration.
1. The ToolHive proxy intercepts tool discovery requests from AI clients.
1. Only enabled tools appear in the client's tool list, with your custom names
   and descriptions if you've set them.
1. If a client attempts to call a disabled tool directly, the proxy blocks the
   request.

This filtering happens transparently without requiring any changes to your AI
client configuration. Your clients automatically see the updated tool list with
customized names and descriptions the next time they connect.

:::tip

If you change tool settings while a client is connected, you may need to restart
the client session to see the updated tool list. Some clients cache tool lists
and don't automatically refresh.

## Example workflows

### Focus on specific GitHub operations

If you're using the GitHub MCP server but only need pull request tools:

1. Open **Customize Tools** for the GitHub server.
1. Disable all tools except those related to pull requests (like
   `create_pull_request`, `get_pull_request`, `list_pull_requests`).
1. Your AI clients now see only pull request tools, making it easier to work
   with GitHub PRs without distraction from issue, branch, or repository tools.

### Create environment-specific tool sets

If you're running the same MCP server in different groups for different
environments:

1. Copy the server to multiple groups (see
   [Organize servers into groups](./group-management.mdx)).
1. Customize tools in each group to match the environment's needs.
1. For example, enable only read-only tools in a production group, while
   allowing all tools in a development group.

### Clarify technical tool names

If an MCP server exposes tools with technical or unclear names:

1. Open **Customize Tools** for the server.
1. Click **Edit** on tools with unclear names.
1. Change the tool name to something more descriptive (for example, rename
   `list_commits_test` to `List Commits`).
1. Update the description to clarify what the tool does in your context.
1. Click **Save**, then **Apply**.
1. Your AI clients now see clearer, more intuitive tool names and descriptions.

## Reset to defaults

To restore all tools to their default enabled state and remove custom overrides:

**To reset an individual tool's name or description:**

1. Click the **Edit** button next to the tool.
1. Clear the **Tool** and **Description** fields (leave them empty).
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Apply** to save your changes.

The tool name and description revert to their original values, and the wrench
icon is removed.

**To enable all tools:**

1. Open the customize tools page for the server.
1. Manually enable all tools using the toggle switches.
1. Click **Apply** to save your changes.
