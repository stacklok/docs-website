  Select which tools from an MCP server are available to your AI clients using

ToolHive lets you customize which tools from a running MCP server are available
to your AI clients. This gives you fine-grained control over the capabilities
exposed by each server, helping you create focused tool sets and reduce
complexity for your AI workflows.

## Why customize tools?

Customizing tools helps you:

- **Reduce complexity**: Hide tools that aren't relevant to your workflow,
  making it easier for AI clients to select the right tool
- **Improve performance**: Fewer tools mean faster tool selection and reduced
  token usage in AI interactions
- **Enhance security**: Limit exposure to only the tools you need, reducing the
  risk of unintended actions
- **Create focused environments**: Tailor tool availability to specific tasks or
  projects

:::info[Registry servers only]

Tool customization is available only for MCP servers installed from the
registry. Custom local and remote MCP servers do not support this feature.

:::

## Access tool customization

To customize tools for a running MCP server:

1. Open the **MCP Servers** page.
1. Find the server you want to customize and click the menu (︙) on its card.
1. Select **Customize Tools** from the dropdown menu.

The customize tools page displays all available tools from the MCP server, each
with a toggle switch and description.

:::note[Server must be running]

The MCP server must be running to view and customize tools. If the server is
stopped when you access the customize tools page, you'll see a message prompting
you to start the server first.

:::

## Enable or disable tools

On the customize tools page:

1. Review the list of available tools and their descriptions.
1. Use the toggle switches to enable or disable individual tools:
   - **Green (enabled)**: The tool is available to AI clients
   - **Gray (disabled)**: The tool is hidden from AI clients
1. Click **Apply** to save your changes.

The ToolHive proxy filters out disabled tools when AI clients connect to the
server. Clients only see and can only call the tools you've enabled.

:::warning[At least one tool required]

You must keep at least one tool enabled. ToolHive prevents you from disabling
all tools on a server, as this would make the server non-functional.

:::

## How filtering works

When you customize tools:

1. You toggle tools on or off using the switches.
1. After clicking **Apply**, your settings are saved to the server
   configuration.
1. The ToolHive proxy intercepts tool discovery requests from AI clients.
1. Only enabled tools appear in the client's tool list.
1. If a client attempts to call a disabled tool directly, the proxy blocks the
   request.

This filtering happens transparently without requiring any changes to your AI
client configuration. Your clients automatically see the updated tool list the
next time they connect.

:::tip

If you change tool settings while a client is connected, you may need to restart
the client session to see the updated tool list. Some clients cache tool lists
and don't automatically refresh.

## Example workflows

### Focus on specific GitHub operations

If you're using the GitHub MCP server but only need pull request tools:

1. Open **Customize Tools** for the GitHub server.
1. Disable all tools except those related to pull requests (like
   `create_pull_request`, `get_pull_request`, `list_pull_requests`).
1. Your AI clients now see only pull request tools, making it easier to work
   with GitHub PRs without distraction from issue, branch, or repository tools.

### Create environment-specific tool sets

If you're running the same MCP server in different groups for different
environments:

1. Copy the server to multiple groups (see
   [Organize servers into groups](./group-management.mdx)).
1. Customize tools in each group to match the environment's needs.
1. For example, enable only read-only tools in a production group, while
   allowing all tools in a development group.

## Reset to defaults

To restore all tools to their default enabled state:

1. Open the customize tools page for the server.
1. Manually enable all tools using the toggle switches.
1. Click **Apply** to save your changes.

There is no automatic "reset all" button, but you can quickly enable all tools
by toggling each switch and clicking **Apply**.
