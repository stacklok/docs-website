  How to organize MCP servers into logical groups and configure client access in
  the ToolHive UI.
---

This guide explains how to organize your MCP servers into logical groups and
configure which groups your MCP clients can access. Groups help you organize
servers by project, environment, or team, and control which tools are available
to different clients.

## Why use groups?

Groups let you organize MCP servers and control client access:

- **Project isolation**: Keep development and production servers separate
- **Environment management**: Organize servers by development stage
- **Client customization**: Configure different tool sets for different clients

:::info[What's the default behavior?]

The `default` group always exists and cannot be deleted. When you add an MCP
server, the `default` group is preselected in the group field unless you choose
a different group.

:::

## View and navigate groups

When the groups feature is enabled, a sidebar appears on the left side of the
**MCP Servers** page listing all your groups. The active group is highlighted.

To view servers in a different group, click on the group name in the sidebar.
The **MCP Servers** page updates to show only the servers in that group.

## Create a group

To create a new group:

1. Open the **MCP Servers** page.
2. Click **Add a group** in the groups sidebar.
3. Enter a unique name for the group.
4. Click **Create** to create the group.

Group names are case-sensitive. For example, "Development" and "development" are
treated as different groups.

:::note

Group names must be unique. If you try to create a group with a name that
already exists, you'll see an error message.

:::

## Assign servers to groups

When you install or configure an MCP server, you assign it to a group. All
server types (registry, custom local, and remote) include a **Group** field in
their configuration forms.

### Assign a server during installation

When installing a new MCP server from the registry or adding a custom server:

1. Fill in the server configuration as usual.
2. In the **Group** field, select the group where you want to add the server.
3. If the group doesn't exist yet, you can create it on the fly from the
   dropdown.
4. Click **Install server** to add the server to the selected group.

### Move a server to a different group

You cannot directly move a server between groups. Instead, you can copy the
server to a different group:

1. On the **MCP Servers** page, find the server you want to copy.
2. Click the menu (︙) on the server card.
3. Select **Copy server to a group**.
4. Choose the destination group.
5. Provide a new name for the server (ToolHive suggests a name based on the
   format `{serverName}-{groupName}`).
6. Click **Copy** to duplicate the server configuration to the new group.

This creates a complete copy of the server in the destination group, preserving
all configuration including secrets, environment variables, and storage volumes.
The original server remains in its current group.

If you want to remove the original server after copying, you can delete it
manually from its original group.

## Manage client access per group

You can control which AI clients have access to servers in each group. This lets
you configure different tool sets for different clients or environments.

To manage client access for a group:

1. Navigate to the group by clicking on its name in the groups sidebar.
2. Click **Manage Clients** on the group page.
3. Toggle the switches to enable or disable clients for this group.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

When you enable a client for a group, ToolHive registers that client to access
all servers in the group. When you disable a client for a group, ToolHive
unregisters the client from that group.

:::tip

You can enable the same client for multiple groups. The client will have access
to servers from all groups where it's enabled.

:::

## Delete a group

To delete a group:

1. Navigate to the group by clicking on its name in the groups sidebar.
2. Click the group actions menu (⋮) in the header.
3. Select **Delete group**.
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog.

:::warning

Deleting a group permanently removes all servers in that group. This action
cannot be undone. If you want to preserve the servers, copy them to another
group before deleting.

:::

You cannot delete the `default` group.

## Example workflows

### Separate development and production servers

1. Create two groups: "development" and "production".
2. Install your MCP servers, assigning development tools to the "development"
   group and production tools to the "production" group.
3. Configure your primary AI client (like GitHub Copilot) to access only the
   "development" group for day-to-day coding work.
4. Use a different client or manually configure clients to access the
   "production" group when needed.

### Project-based organization

1. Create groups for each project: "webapp-frontend", "webapp-backend", and
   "mobile-app".
2. Install project-specific MCP servers in each group (for example, React tools
   in "webapp-frontend", database tools in "webapp-backend").
3. Configure different AI clients or workspaces to access the appropriate groups
   for each project.
