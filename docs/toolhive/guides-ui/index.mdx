## Introduction

The ToolHive UI is a desktop application that makes it easy to run and manage
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers on your local machine. It provides a
user-friendly interface to discover, deploy, and manage MCP servers with
security and ease of use built in.

It's designed for anyone who wants to run MCP servers without needing to
understand the complexities of Docker or command-line tools. Whether you're a
developer, researcher, or just curious about MCP servers, ToolHive provides a
simple way to get started.

:::tip[Advanced users]

If you want more control or want to experiment with more advanced features like
custom permissions and telemetry, the ToolHive UI can work side-by-side with the
[ToolHive CLI](../guides-cli/index.mdx) while still providing a graphical
interface to quickly see and control your MCP servers.
