## Prerequisites

Before installing ToolHive, make sure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating systems**:
  - macOS (Apple silicon or Intel)
  - Windows 10/11 (x64)
  - Linux (x86_64/amd64)
- **Container runtime**:
  - Docker / Docker Desktop
  - Podman / Podman Desktop
  - Rancher Desktop with the dockerd/moby runtime (experimental)

ToolHive requires minimal CPU, memory, and disk space. The exact requirements
depend on how many MCP servers you run and the resources they use.

## Install ToolHive

Select your operating system to see the installation instructions.

<Tabs groupId='os' queryString='os'>
<TabItem value='macos' label='macOS' default>

Download the latest ToolHive installer for
[Apple silicon](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive-arm64.dmg)
or
[Intel-based](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive-x64.dmg)
Macs and open the DMG file.

Copy the ToolHive app to your Applications folder. You can then open it from
your Applications folder, Launchpad, or using Spotlight search.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

Download the latest
[ToolHive installer](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive.Setup.exe)
and run the setup executable.

After installation, you can find ToolHive in your Start menu or on your desktop.

:::info[Important]

The first time you run ToolHive, you may be prompted to allow firewall access.
If you don't allow this, ToolHive won't be able to run MCP servers.

1. Download the appropriate RPM or DEB package for your distribution from the
   [ToolHive UI releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest)

2. Use your package manager to install the downloaded package:
   - For RPM-based distributions (like Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux):

     ```bash
     sudo rpm -i ToolHive-<VERSION>-1.x86_64.rpm
     ```

   - For DEB-based distributions (like Ubuntu or Debian):

     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i toolhive_<VERSION>_amd64.deb
     ```

For other Linux distributions, download the
[binary tarball](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/toolhive-studio-linux-x64.tar.gz)
and extract it, then run the `ToolHive` binary directly.

## System tray icon

When you close the ToolHive application window, it continues running in the
background so your MCP servers remain available. ToolHive installs a system tray
icon for quick access. You can use it to:

- Enable or disable **Start on login**
- Show or hide the ToolHive application window
- Quit ToolHive, which stops all running MCP servers

## Application settings

Open the ToolHive settings screen from the gear icon (⚙️) in the application
window. The settings screen allows you to configure various options:

- **Display theme**: Choose between light and dark themes for the application.
  ToolHive matches your system theme by default.
- **Start on login**: Automatically start ToolHive when you log in to your
  system. MCP servers that were running when you quit ToolHive are restarted
  automatically.
- **Error reporting**: Enable or disable error reporting and telemetry data
  collection.
- **Skip quit confirmation**: Skip the MCP server shutdown confirmation dialog
  when quitting ToolHive.

From the settings screen, you can also view version information and download the
application log file for troubleshooting.

## Upgrade ToolHive

ToolHive automatically checks for updates. When a new version is available,
you'll see a notification in the application. During the upgrade, ToolHive stops
all running MCP servers, updates the application, and then restarts itself and
the MCP servers.

You can also manually install updates by downloading the latest installer for
your operating system from the
[ToolHive UI releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest)
and running it. The installer will upgrade your existing ToolHive installation
to the latest version. See the [Install ToolHive](#install-toolhive) section for
direct download links.

## File locations

ToolHive stores its configuration and data files in several locations depending
on your operating system:

<Tabs groupId='os' queryString='os'>
<TabItem value='macos' label='macOS' default>

- The `~/Library/Application Support/ToolHive` directory contains:
  - Configuration files and application data for the ToolHive UI
  - MCP server logs and configurations (`logs/` and `runconfigs/` directories)
  - Your encrypted secrets store (`secrets_encrypted` file)
  - ToolHive CLI/API configuration file (`config.yaml`)
- The main UI application log is located at `~/Library/Logs/ToolHive/main.log`

Since macOS is not case sensitive, the `~/Library/Application Support/ToolHive`
directory is shared by the UI and CLI if you have both installed.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

- The `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ToolHive` directory contains:
  - Application executables and installation logs
  - MCP server logs and configurations (`logs/` and `runconfigs/` directories)
  - Your encrypted secrets store (`secrets_encrypted` file)
  - ToolHive CLI/API configuration file (`config.yaml`)
- The `%APPDATA%\ToolHive` directory contains:
  - Configuration files and application data for the ToolHive UI
- The main UI application log is located at `%APPDATA%\ToolHive\logs\main.log`

Since Windows is not case sensitive, the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ToolHive` directory is
shared by the UI and CLI if you have both installed.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='linux' label='Linux'>

- The `~/.config/ToolHive` directory contains:
  - Configuration files and application data for the ToolHive UI
- The `~/.config/toolhive` directory contains (note the case sensitivity):
  - MCP server logs and configurations (`logs/` and `runconfigs/` directories)
  - Your encrypted secrets store (`secrets_encrypted` file)
  - ToolHive CLI/API configuration file (`config.yaml`)
- The main UI application log is located at `~/.config/ToolHive/logs/main.log`

Since Linux is case sensitive, the `~/.config/ToolHive` and `~/.config/toolhive`
directories are separate. However, the ToolHive UI and CLI share the same
configuration file and secrets store to support coexistence.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also download the application log file from the **Settings** screen (⚙️)
in the ToolHive UI.

## Telemetry and error reporting

ToolHive uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for error tracking and
performance monitoring to help us identify and fix issues, improve stability,
and enhance the user experience. This telemetry is enabled by default. You can
disable this by turning off the **Error reporting** option in the settings
screen (⚙️) if you prefer not to share this data.

ToolHive collects the following information:

- Error reports and crash logs
- Performance metrics
- Usage patterns

This data is anonymized and does not include any personally identifiable
information. It helps us understand how ToolHive is used and identify areas for
improvement. Review the
[Stacklok privacy policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/29074746) and
[Terms of Service](https://stacklok.com/terms-of-service) for more details.

## Next steps

Now that you have ToolHive installed, you can start using it to run and manage
MCP servers. See [Run MCP servers](./run-mcp-servers.md) to get started.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Connection Refused error on startup</summary>

If you see a "Connection Refused" error when starting ToolHive, your container
runtime (Docker or Podman) is likely not installed, not running, or not
configured correctly.

Follow the instructions in the error message to install or start your container
runtime. For example, if you're using Docker Desktop, make sure it's running and
that the Docker daemon is active.

If the retry button doesn't work, restart ToolHive.

</details>

<details>
<summary>No system tray icon on Linux</summary>

Recent versions of Fedora Linux and other distributions have removed the
AppIndicator extension from their default installations. ToolHive requires this
extension for the system tray icon to work properly.

On Fedora, install the `gnome-shell-extension-appindicator` package:

```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-appindicator
```

You'll need to log out and log back in to activate the extension.

Alternatively, install the
[Extension Manager](https://github.com/mjakeman/extension-manager) app. It's
available as a native package in many distributions, or you can install it from
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager). Then, use
Extension Manager to install the
[AppIndicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)
extension (listed as "AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support").

The ToolHive icon should now appear in your system tray.
