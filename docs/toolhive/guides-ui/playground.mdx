The playground feature in ToolHive allows you to test and validate MCP servers
directly within the UI, without requiring additional client setup. This
streamlined testing environment helps teams quickly evaluate functionality and
behavior before deploying MCP servers to production environments.

## Key capabilities

### Instant testing of MCP servers

Enter an AI model API key, select your MCP servers and tools, and begin testing
immediately—right inside the desktop app. The playground eliminates the friction
of setting up external AI clients just to validate that your MCP servers are
working correctly.

### Transparent audit logs

See tool details, parameters, and execution results directly in the UI, ensuring
full visibility into tool performance and responses. Every interaction is
logged, making it easy to understand exactly what your MCP servers are doing and
how they're responding to requests.

### Integrated ToolHive management

The playground includes a dedicated MCP server for ToolHive itself, allowing you
to manage your MCP servers directly through natural language commands. You can
list servers, check their status, start or stop them, and perform other
management tasks using conversational AI.

## Getting started

To start using the playground feature:

1. **Access the playground**: Click the **Playground** tab in the ToolHive UI
   navigation bar.

2. **Configure API keys**: Click **Configure your API Keys** to set up access to
   AI model providers.

   - **OpenAI**: Enter your OpenAI API key to use GPT models
   - **Anthropic**: Add your Anthropic API key for Claude models
   - **Google**: Configure Google AI API key for Gemini models
   - **xAI**: Set up xAI API key for Grok models
   - **OpenRouter**: Add OpenRouter API key for access to multiple model providers

3. **Select MCP tools**: Click the tools icon to manage which MCP servers and
   tools are available in the playground.

    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/toolhive-ui-playground-thv-mcp-dark.webp'),
  }}

/>

   - View all your running MCP servers
   - Enable or disable specific tools from each server
   - Search and filter tools by name or functionality
   - The `toolhive mcp` server is included by default, providing management
     capabilities

4. **Start testing**: Begin chatting with your chosen AI model. The model will
   have access to all enabled MCP tools and can execute them based on your
   requests.

## Using the playground

### Testing MCP server functionality

The playground is ideal for validating that your MCP servers work as expected:

```text
Can you list all my MCP servers and show their current status?
```

The AI will use the `list_servers` tool from the ToolHive MCP server to provide
a comprehensive overview of your server status.

<ThemedImage
  alt='ToolHive playground showing AI response with MCP tool execution results'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/toolhive/toolhive-ui-playground-chat-response-light.webp'
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      '/img/toolhive/toolhive-ui-playground-chat-response-dark.webp'
    ),
  }}
  title='Chat response showing tool execution and results'
/>

Or test that an individual MCP tool is working as expected:

```text
Use the GitHub MCP server to search for recent issues in the microsoft/vscode repository
```

If you have the GitHub MCP server running, the AI will execute the appropriate
GitHub API calls and return formatted results.

### Managing servers through conversation

The ToolHive desktop app automatically spins up a dedicated MCP server
(`toolhive mcp`) that orchestrates ToolHive operations through natural language
commands. This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Unified interface**: Manage your MCP infrastructure using the same
  conversational AI interface you use for testing
- **Contextual operations**: The AI understands your current server state and
  can make intelligent decisions about which servers to start, stop, or
  troubleshoot
- **Reduced complexity**: No need to switch between the chat interface and
  traditional UI controls—everything can be done through conversation
- **Audit trail**: All management operations are logged in the same transparent
  way as tool executions, providing clear visibility into what actions were
  taken

Take advantage of these integrated ToolHive management tools:

```text
Start the fetch MCP server for me
```

```text
Stop all unhealthy MCP servers
```

```text
Show me the logs for the meta-mcp server
```

### Validating tool responses

The playground shows detailed information about each tool execution:

- **Tool name and description**: What tool was called and its purpose
- **Input parameters**: The exact parameters passed to the tool
- **Execution status**: Whether the tool succeeded or failed
- **Response data**: The complete response from the tool
- **Timing information**: How long the tool took to execute

This visibility helps you understand exactly how your MCP servers are behaving
and identify any issues with tool implementation or configuration.

## Best practices

### API key security

- Use dedicated API keys for testing that have appropriate rate limits
- Regularly rotate API keys used in development environments
- Consider using API keys with restricted permissions for testing purposes

### Server management

- Start only the MCP servers you need for testing to improve performance
- Use the playground to validate new server configurations before connecting
  them to production AI clients
- Test different combinations of tools to understand how they work together

### Testing workflow

1. **Isolated testing**: Test individual MCP servers one at a time to validate
   their functionality
2. **Integration testing**: Enable multiple servers to test how they work
   together
3. **Performance validation**: Monitor tool execution times and responses under
   different loads
4. **Error handling**: Intentionally trigger error conditions to validate proper
   error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

<details>
<summary>API key not working</summary>

If your API key isn't working:

1. Verify the API key is correct and has proper permissions
2. Check that you have sufficient quota or credits with the provider
3. Ensure the API key hasn't expired or been revoked
4. Try creating a new API key from the provider's dashboard

</details>

<details>
<summary>MCP tools not appearing</summary>

If your MCP server tools aren't showing up:

1. Verify the MCP server is running (check the **MCP Servers** page)
2. Click the tools icon and ensure the server's tools are enabled
3. Try restarting the MCP server if it shows as unhealthy
4. Check the server logs for any error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tool execution failing</summary>

If tools are failing to execute:

1. Check the tool's parameter requirements in the audit log
2. Verify any required secrets or environment variables are configured
3. Ensure the MCP server has necessary permissions (network access, file system
   access)
4. Review the server logs for detailed error information
