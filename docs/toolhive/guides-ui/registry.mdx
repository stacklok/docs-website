ToolHive includes a built-in registry of MCP servers with verified
configurations that meet a
[minimum quality standard](../concepts/registry-criteria.mdx), allowing you to
discover and deploy high-quality tools effortlessly. You can browse the
registry, select servers, and run them securely through the user interface.

You can also configure ToolHive to use a custom registry instead. This is useful
for organizations that want to maintain their own private registry of MCP
servers.

## Find MCP servers

The ToolHive interface includes a dedicated **Registry** section in the main
menu. This section lets you explore the various MCP servers available in either
the built-in or custom registry.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/toolhive-ui-registry-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='ToolHive Registry Page'
/>

The registry interface displays a list of available servers. You can browse
through the list, use search functionality, and click on any server to view
detailed information before installing it.

## View server details

Click on any server in the registry to view detailed information including:

- **Server name and description**: Full description of what the server does
- **Tier badge**: Shows whether the server is **Official** or **Community**
- **Transport type**: Shows the communication method (e.g., stdio)
- **Popularity**: Star count and download statistics
- **Provenance**: Security verification status (e.g., "Provenance signed by
  Sigstore")
- **Tools listed**: Names of all available tools the server provides
- **Action buttons**: **Install server** and **GitHub** (if repository
  available)

This detailed view helps you understand the server's purpose and capabilities
before adding it to your ToolHive installation.

## Registry settings

To configure your registry, ToolHive provides a dedicated **Registry** settings
section in **Settings** → **Registry** with three options:

- **Default Registry** - Use ToolHive's built-in verified registry
- **Remote Registry (URL)** - Specify a custom URL for a remote registry hosted
  on a web server
- **Local Registry (File Path)** - Specify a local file path to a JSON registry
  file on your system

When you select **Local Registry (File Path)**, an additional **Registry File
Path** field appears where you need to provide the absolute path to your local
JSON registry file (for example: `/path/myregistry/db.json`). Click **Save** to
apply your configuration.

For detailed information on creating a custom registry, see the
[custom registry tutorial](../tutorials/custom-registry.mdx).

## Next steps

After exploring the registry and finding servers you want to use:

- **Install servers**: Click on servers from the registry to install and
  configure them for your environment
- **Customize tools**: Selectively enable or disable tools from installed
  registry servers to create focused tool sets
- **Manage running servers**: Use the **MCP Servers** section to start, stop,
  and monitor your installed servers
- **Create custom registries**: Set up your own private registry for
  organization-specific servers
