ToolHive makes it easy to run and manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
This guide walks you through installing MCP servers from the registry, using
Docker images, or from source packages.

## Install from the registry

ToolHive includes a built-in registry of MCP servers that meet a
[minimum quality standard](../concepts/registry-criteria.md), allowing you to
discover and deploy high-quality tools effortlessly. Simply select one from the
list to run it securely with just a few clicks.

### Select an MCP server

{/* prettier-ignore */}
To install an MCP server (local <img src="/img/mcp-servers/local-mcp.svg" width="16" className="theme-icon" alt="Local MCP icon" />
or remote {/* prettier-ignore */} <img
  src='/img/mcp-servers/remote-mcp.svg'
  width='16'
  className='theme-icon'
  alt='Remote MCP icon'
/> ) from the registry:

1. Open the **Registry** page from the menu bar.
1. Browse or search for the MCP server you want to install.
1. Click on the desired MCP server to open its details page. Here you can review
   more information about the server like its:
   - Description
   - Available tools
   - Tier (community or official)
   - Popularity (GitHub stars)
   - A link to the GitHub repository for more details and usage documentation
1. Click the **Install server** button to start the installation process.

### Configure the server

<Tabs queryString="server-type" lazy>
  <TabItem
    value='local'
    label={
      <>
        <img src="/img/mcp-servers/local-mcp.svg" width="16" className="theme-icon spacing-icon" alt="Local MCP icon" />
        {' '}Local MCP
      </>
    }
    default>

**Local MCP servers** run directly on your machine using your container runtime.

The configuration form is pre-filled with defaults from the registry. Enter the
remaining required information and adjust any optional settings as needed:

1. **Server name**: A unique name for the MCP server.\
   This defaults to the MCP server's name in the registry. If you want to run
   multiple instances of the same MCP server, give each instance a unique name.

1. **Command arguments** (optional):\
   Enter any command-line arguments needed to run the MCP server. These might be
   needed to pass application-specific parameters to the MCP server. Refer to
   the MCP server's documentation for details.

   :::info

   We've made every effort to include sensible defaults in the registry for a
   one-click experience, but some servers may require additional command-line
   arguments to function correctly.

   :::

1. **Storage volumes** [Optional]:\
   Map files or folders from your local host to the MCP server. See
   [Mount host files and folders](#volumes). [Optional]

1. **Secrets** and **environment variables** expected by the server are
   populated from the registry automatically. Required values are marked with an
   asterisk (\*).
   1. **Secrets**: Enter a value to create a new secret or select an existing
      secret to map to the environment variable. Secrets are stored securely and
      can be used by the MCP server without exposing them in plaintext.
   2. **Environment variables**: Enter the value in the input field alongside
      the variable name. These are typically used for configuration options that
      do not require sensitive data.

1. **Network isolation** [Optional]:\
   Enable network isolation to restrict the MCP server's network access. This
   enhances security by limiting the server's ability to communicate with
   external networks. See the [Network isolation](./network-isolation.mdx) guide
   for details.

:::note

Refer to the MCP server's documentation for the required configuration
information, permissions, and authentication details. A link to the GitHub
repository is provided on each server's details page.

**Remote MCP servers** are hosted services that you connect to.

The configuration form is pre-filled with defaults from the registry. Enter the
remaining required information and adjust any optional settings as needed:

1. A unique **name** for the MCP server. [Required]
1. The **URL** of the remote MCP server. [Required]
1. The **transport protocol** that the MCP server uses. [Required]\
   ToolHive supports server-sent events (SSE) and Streamable HTTP (default) for
   real-time communication. The protocol must match what the MCP server
   supports.
1. **Authorization method**: Choose how ToolHive should authenticate with the
   remote server.\
   The default is **Dynamic Client Registration**. For MCP servers that fully
   implement the MCP authorization spec including dynamic client registration
   (RFC7591), ToolHive automatically:
   - Discovers OAuth/OIDC endpoints
   - Registers a new OAuth client
   - Obtains and manages client credentials
   - Handles token lifecycle automatically

   For MCP servers that require manual configuration, ToolHive supports OAuth2
   and OIDC authentication. Obtain the necessary information from the MCP
   server's documentation or administrator.

   **OAuth2 authentication options:**
   - **Authorize URL**: The URL where users are redirected to authenticate and
     authorize access to the MCP server. [Required]
   - **Token URL**: The URL where your application exchanges the authorization
     code for access tokens. [Required]
   - **Client ID**: Your application's identifier registered with the OAuth
     provider. [Required]
   - **Client secret**: The secret key that proves your application's identity.
     Enter a value to create a new secret or select an existing secret from the
     provider. Secrets are stored securely and can be used by the MCP server
     without exposing them in plaintext. See
     [Secrets management](./secrets-management.md) for details. [Optional]
   - **Scopes**: List of permissions your application is requesting. [Optional]
   - **PKCE**: Enable Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636) for enhanced
     security without requiring a client secret. [Optional]

   **OIDC authentication options:**
   - **Issuer URL**: The base URL of the OIDC provider. [Required]
   - **Client ID**: Your application's identifier registered with the OIDC
     provider. [Required]
   - **Client secret**: The secret key that proves your application's identity.
     Enter a value to create a new secret or select an existing secret from the
     provider. Secrets are stored securely and can be used by the MCP server
     without exposing them in plaintext. See
     [Secrets management](./secrets-management.md) for details. [Optional]
   - **PKCE**: Enable Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636) for enhanced
     security without requiring a client secret. [Optional]

1. The **callback port** for the authentication redirect. [Required]

## Mount host files and folders \{#volumes}

Some MCP servers need access to files on your machine. You can mount host paths
directly in the UI.

1. In the server **Install / Configure** dialog, scroll to **Storage volumes**.
2. Use the **first row** to create your mount:
   - **Host path** — choose a file or folder on your computer.
   - **Container path** — where it should appear inside the server (for example,
     `/data`).
   - By default, mounts are in read-write mode. If you want your volume mount to
     be **Read-only**, select the "Read-only access" option from the drop-down.
3. If you need additional mounts, click **Add a volume** and repeat.
4. Click **Install server** to start the server with your volume(s).

This applies to both registry-installed servers and custom servers (Docker image
or source package).

## Manage MCP servers

On the **MCP Servers** page, you can manage your installed MCP servers:

- **Start/Stop**: Use the toggle button to start or stop the MCP server. When
  you stop a server, it remains in the list but is no longer running. ToolHive
  removes the server from connected AI clients while stopped.
- **Copy URL**: Click the menu (︙) on the server card and select the **Copy**
  icon (⧉) to copy the MCP server's URL to your clipboard. This URL is used by
  AI clients to connect to the MCP server.
- **Edit configuration**: Click the menu (︙) on the server card and select
  **Edit configuration** to open a dialog where you can modify the server's
  settings, such as command arguments, environment variables, secrets, storage
  volumes, and network isolation. The dialog is pre-filled with your existing
  configuration, so you only need to change the specific settings you want to
  update.
- **View logs**: Click the menu (︙) on the server card and select **View logs**
  to see the server's output.
- **Remove server**: Click the menu (︙) on the server card and select **Remove
  server** to stop and remove the MCP server from ToolHive. This deletes the
  container and any associated configuration, so use with caution.

When you quit the application, ToolHive prompts you to stop all running MCP
servers. The running servers are recorded and ToolHive restarts them
automatically the next time you launch the application.

## Next steps

- Connect ToolHive to AI clients like GitHub Copilot or Cursor using the
  [client configuration guide](./client-configuration.mdx).
- Learn more about [secrets management](./secrets-management.md) to securely
  manage API tokens and other sensitive data.
- Test your MCP servers using the [playground](./playground.mdx) to validate
  functionality and behavior with different models.
