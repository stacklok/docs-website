# What is ToolHive?

ToolHive is an enterprise-grade open source (Apache 2.0) platform for running
and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Follow the [getting started guide](./tutorials/quickstart-ui.mdx) to install
ToolHive locally and run your first MCP server.

To learn more about the Model Context Protocol, see our
[MCP primer](./concepts/mcp-primer.mdx).

## ToolHive components

ToolHive includes everything you need to use MCP servers in production. It's
made up of four key components: the Runtime, Registry Server, Gateway, and
Portal.

### Runtime

The ToolHive Runtime is the core component that runs MCP servers in isolated
containers. It provides a secure and scalable environment for deploying MCP
servers, with features like fine-grained permissions, network access controls,
and secret management.

The ToolHive Runtime is available in three different editions to suit different
use cases:

- [**ToolHive UI**](./guides-ui/index.mdx): A desktop application for individual
  developers to run and manage MCP servers locally. It provides a user-friendly
  interface to discover, deploy, and manage MCP servers.

- [**ToolHive CLI**](./guides-cli/index.mdx): A command line interface to deploy
  and manage MCP servers on your local machine or in development environments.
  It allows quick deployment of MCP servers and supports advanced features like
  telemetry and fine-grained authorization policies.

- [**ToolHive Kubernetes Operator**](./guides-k8s/index.mdx): A Kubernetes
  operator for teams and enterprises to run and manage MCP servers in multi-user
  environments. It provides centralized management, security controls, and
  integration with existing infrastructure.

### Registry Server

The [**ToolHive Registry Server**](./guides-registry/index.mdx) is an
implementation of the official
[MCP Registry API](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/generic-registry-api.md).
Curate a catalog of trusted servers from multiple backend sources for users to
quickly discover and deploy. It can be deployed standalone or as part of the
ToolHive Operator.

### Gateway

Implemented in the ToolHive Kubernetes Operator as the
[**Virtual MCP Server (vMCP)**](./guides-vmcp/index.mdx), the ToolHive Gateway
is a secure proxy for MCP server connectivity, aggregation, and orchestration.
It's available as part of the ToolHive Operator for Kubernetes deployments.

### Portal

The ToolHive Portal is how users discover and install MCP servers. It's
available as a cross-platform desktop app (the ToolHive UI) and an experimental
[web-based frontend](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-cloud-ui) to the
ToolHive Registry Server.

### Better together

ToolHive components work together to provide a seamless experience for both
admins and users:

1. **Admins** curate and organize MCP servers in the **Registry**, configuring
   access and policies.
2. **Users** discover and request MCP servers from the **Portal**, and ToolHive
   orchestrates installation and access.
3. **Runtime** securely deploys and manages MCP servers across local and cloud
   environments, integrating seamlessly with existing SDLC workflows, exporting
   analytics, and enforcing fine-grained access control.
4. **Gateway** handles all inbound traffic, secures context and credentials,
   optimizes tool selection, and applies organizational policies.

## Why ToolHive?

We want to help you get real value from MCP servers. While there are plenty of
tools to help you quickly build MCP servers, the obstacles to using those
servers effectively are largely operational. ToolHive addresses the runtime,
security, and other considerations necessary to use MCP servers with confidence
and in production.

We address those considerations with proven, familiar technologies like
containers and Kubernetes.

ToolHive lets you run any MCP server, regardless of its underlying technology
stack, even when the original authors didn't provide container images. We
containerize the MCP server and let you use a simple CLI or Kubernetes to manage
MCP deployments at any scale. Coordinate all your MCP servers from one place
with sensible security controls and container-native simplicity.

## Key features

ToolHive includes a range of capabilities to help you run and manage MCP servers
effectively:

**Runtime:**

- Run local MCP servers instantly from the built-in registry of vetted MCP
  servers, any Docker container, or directly from package managers
- Deploy MCP servers in the cloud via Kubernetes for enterprise scalability
- Proxy remote MCP servers securely for unified management
- Apply fine-grained permissions and network access filtering
- Protect sensitive data with built-in secrets management and enterprise OAuth
  integrations
- Leverage OpenTelemetry and Prometheus for observability and audit logging

**Registry Server:**

- Curate a catalog of trusted MCP servers from multiple sources: the official
  MCP Registry, other public registries, and custom files
- Group servers based on role or use case
- Manage your registry with an API-driven interface
- Preset configurations and permissions for a frictionless user experience

**Gateway:**

- Orchestrate multiple tools with a deterministic workflow engine
- Centralize control of security policy, authentication, authorization,
  auditing, etc.
- Customize and filter tools and descriptions to improve performance and reduce
  token usage

**Portal:**

- Cross-platform [desktop app](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio) and
  browser-based [cloud UI](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-cloud-ui)
- Make it easy for end users to discover and deploy MCP servers
- Install MCP servers with a single click
- Connect with local clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and many more
