# What is ToolHive?

ToolHive simplifies the deployment and management of Model Context Protocol
(MCP) servers. It ensures ease of use, consistency, and security by running
containers in a locked-down environment with minimal permissions.

Follow the [getting started guide](./tutorials/quickstart-ui.mdx) to install
ToolHive and run your first MCP server.

To learn more about the Model Context Protocol, see our
[MCP primer](./concepts/mcp-primer.mdx).

ToolHive is available in three modes to suit different use cases:

- [**ToolHive UI**](./guides-ui/index.mdx): A desktop application for individual
  developers to run and manage MCP servers locally. It provides a user-friendly
  interface to discover, deploy, and manage MCP servers.

- [**ToolHive CLI**](./guides-cli/index.mdx): A command line interface to deploy
  and manage MCP servers on your local machine or in development environments.
  It allows quick deployment of MCP servers and supports advanced features like
  custom permissions and telemetry.

- [**ToolHive Kubernetes Operator**](./guides-k8s/index.mdx): A Kubernetes
  operator for teams and enterprises to run and manage MCP servers in multi-user
  environments. It provides centralized management, security controls, and
  integration with existing infrastructure.

## Why ToolHive?

We want to help you get real value from MCP servers. While there are plenty of
tools to help you quickly build MCP servers, the obstacles to using those
servers effectively are largely operational. ToolHive addresses the runtime,
security, and other considerations necessary to use MCP servers with confidence
and in production.

We address those considerations with proven, familiar technologies like
containers and Kubernetes.

ToolHive lets you run any MCP server, regardless of its underlying technology
stack, even when the original authors didn't provide container images. We
containerize the MCP server and let you use a simple CLI or Kubernetes to manage
MCP deployments at any scale. Coordinate all your MCP servers from one place
with sensible security controls and container-native simplicity.

## Architecture overview

ToolHive exposes an HTTP proxy to forward requests to MCP servers running in
containers. The proxy communicates with MCP servers via standard input/output
(stdio), server-sent events (SSE), or Streamable HTTP. The ToolHive CLI
interacts with Docker or Podman via the Docker socket API, letting it manage
containers and their configurations.

## Key features

ToolHive includes a range of features to help you run and manage MCP servers
effectively:

- **Streamlined deployment**: Deploy MCP servers instantly using Docker
  containers or directly from package managers via protocol schemes (`uvx://`,
  `npx://`, `go://`). Access a curated registry of verified MCP servers that you
  can discover and run effortlessly.

- **Seamless integration**: Configure popular development tools automatically,
  including GitHub Copilot and Cursor, to streamline your workflow with minimal
  setup.

- **Comprehensive security**: Run MCP servers in isolated containers with
  customizable, fine-grained permissions and network access filtering using JSON
  profiles. Securely manage secrets and configurations using built-in encrypted
  storage or 1Password integration, eliminating plaintext secrets in
  configuration files.

- **Enterprise readiness**: Implement robust OAuth-based authorization controls
  for enterprise environments that integrate seamlessly with existing
  infrastructure.

- **Kubernetes deployment**: Deploy and manage MCP servers in Kubernetes
  clusters using the ToolHive operator.
