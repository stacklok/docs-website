import ClientTable from '../_partials/_client-compat-table.md';

This page shows which AI clients work with ToolHive and how they connect to MCP
servers.

## Supported clients

We've tested ToolHive with these clients:

<ClientTable />

The minimum versions listed are the earliest versions that support the
Streamable HTTP transport protocol.

You can also use other clients and development libraries that support the SSE
and/or Streamable HTTP protocol, but you'll need to configure them manually.

## Client requirements

To work with ToolHive, your client needs to:

1. Support the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. Connect to MCP servers using the server-sent events (SSE) or Streamable HTTP
   transport protocol
3. Have the correct MCP server URL configured

## Automatic configuration support

ToolHive can automatically configure supported clients to connect to MCP
servers. See the
[UI client configuration](../guides-ui/client-configuration.mdx) or
[CLI client configuration guide](../guides-cli/client-configuration.mdx) for
more details.

Check the table above to see which clients support automatic configuration.

For other clients, you'll need to set up the MCP server URL yourself.

## Configuration locations

ToolHive manages client configurations in their standard locations.

### VS Code with Copilot

GitHub Copilot in VS Code stores its
[global MCP configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-user-settings)
in your VS Code user settings file.

:::note

VS Code versions prior to v1.102 stored MCP server settings in the main
`settings.json` file. As of v1.102, this has moved to a dedicated `mcp.json`
file.

ToolHive v0.2.0 and works with VS Code 1.102+ and updates the `mcp.json` file
when you run an MCP server.

If you're using an older version of either ToolHive or VS Code, automatic client
configuration will not work as expected and you will need to manually update
your configurations. We recommend upgrading both for the best experience.

:::

**Standard version**:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/mcp.json`

**Insiders edition**:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/User/mcp.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Code - Insiders/User/mcp.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "http" }
  }
}
```

When you register VS Code as a client, ToolHive automatically updates the global
MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-workspace)
by creating a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

### Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.so/) stores its global MCP configuration in a JSON file
in your home directory.

- **All platforms**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Cursor automatically detects the transport mode for HTTP MCP servers.

When you register Cursor as a client, ToolHive automatically updates the global
MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations)
by creating a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) stores its global (user
scope) MCP configuration in a JSON file in your home directory.

- **All platforms**: `~/.claude.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  // Other Claude Code settings...

  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "http" }
  }
}
```

When you register Claude Code as a client, ToolHive automatically updates the
global MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#understanding-mcp-server-scopes)
by creating a `.mcp.json` file in your project directory, or add servers using
the `claude` CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope <user|project> --transport sse fetch http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch
```

### Roo Code and Cline

[Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) (previously Roo Cline) and
[Cline](https://cline.bot/) store their global MCP configuration in their VS
Code extension settings directory. Both use the same configuration format.

**Roo Code**:

- **macOS**:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**:
  `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

**Cline**:

- **macOS**:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**:
  `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "streamable-http" }
    // Note: Cline uses "streamableHttp" instead of "streamable-http"
  }
}
```

When you register Roo Code or Cline as a client, ToolHive automatically updates
the global MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP server. With Roo Code,
you can also configure
[project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.roocode.com/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo#editing-mcp-settings-files)
by creating a `.roo/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

## Manual configuration

If your client doesn't support automatic configuration, you'll need to set up
the MCP server URL manually.

### Example: PydanticAI

For [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), set the MCP server URL in your code:

```python
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerSSE
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHTTP

# For Server-Sent Events (SSE)
server = MCPServerSSE(url='http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch')

# For Streamable HTTP
server = MCPServerStreamableHTTP(url='http://localhost:51712/mcp')
```

### Example: Continue

For the [Continue](https://continue.dev) extension in VS Code or JetBrains, edit
your `~/.continue/config.yaml` file or project-specific
`.continue/mcpServers/<name>.yaml` file to include the MCP server URL:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: fetch
    type: sse
    url: http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch
```

Continue supports SSE (`type: sse`) and Streamable HTTP
(`type: streamable-http`) transports.

### Example: Copilot for JetBrains IDEs

For the
[GitHub Copilot plugin in JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
(IntelliJ, Pydantic, etc.), edit your `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json` file
to include the MCP server URL:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "http" }
  }
}
```

Copilot for JetBrains supports SSE (`"type": "sse"`) and Streamable HTTP
(`"type": "streamable-http"`) transports.

### STDIO-only client configuration

Some MCP clients, like Claude Desktop, only support MCP servers that communicate
via STDIO transport. However, many popular MCP servers use Server-Sent Events
(SSE) or Streamable HTTP transport protocols.

ToolHive's `thv proxy stdio` command transforms servers using SSE or Streamable
HTTP into STDIO-compatible processes, enabling these clients to work with any
MCP server.

**How it works:**

1. ToolHive runs the MCP server in its container with its default transport
   (SSE, HTTP, or other)
2. The `thv proxy stdio` command sets up a STDIO-level wrapper pointing to that
   existing server
3. Your client interacts with this wrapper just like any other STDIO MCP server

**Example:**

First, run an MCP server with SSE transport:

```bash
thv run osv --transport sse --name osv
```

Then configure your client to use the proxy stdio command. For Claude Desktop,
update your configuration file (typically located at
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osv": {
      "command": "thv",
      "args": ["proxy", "stdio", "osv"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

The workload name you pass to `thv proxy stdio` (in this case, `osv`) must match
the name you used when running the server with `thv run`.

:::

After restarting your client, the MCP server's tools will be available for use,
even though it uses SSE transport.

For more details, see the
[`thv proxy stdio` CLI reference](../reference/cli/thv_proxy_stdio.md).
