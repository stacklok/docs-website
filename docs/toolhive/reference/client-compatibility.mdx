import ClientTable from '../_partials/_client-compat-table.md';

This page shows which AI clients work with ToolHive and how they connect to MCP
servers.

## Supported clients

We've tested ToolHive with these clients:

<ClientTable />

The minimum versions listed are the earliest versions that support the
Streamable HTTP transport protocol.

You can also use other clients and development libraries that support the SSE
and/or Streamable HTTP protocol, but you'll need to configure them manually.

## Client requirements

To work with ToolHive, your client needs to:

1. Support the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. Connect to MCP servers using the server-sent events (SSE) transport protocol
3. Have the correct MCP server URL configured

## Automatic configuration support

ToolHive can automatically configure supported clients to connect to MCP
servers. You can either register clients manually or use auto-discovery, which
finds and configures supported clients on your system automatically.

Check the table above to see which clients support automatic configuration and
auto-discovery.

For other clients, you'll need to set up the MCP server URL yourself.

## Configuration locations

ToolHive manages client configurations in their standard locations.

### VS Code with Copilot

GitHub Copilot in VS Code stores its
[global MCP configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-user-settings)
in your VS Code user settings file.

**Standard version**:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

**Insiders edition**:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/User/settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Code - Insiders/User/settings.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  // Other VS Code settings...

  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
      "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
      "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "http" }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

You need to manually start MCP servers from the settings file. Open the command
palette and select "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)".

:::

When you register VS Code as a client or enable auto-discovery, ToolHive
automatically updates the global MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP
server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-workspace)
by creating a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

### Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.so/) stores its global MCP configuration in a JSON file
in your home directory.

- **All platforms**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Cursor automatically detects the transport mode for HTTP MCP servers.

When you register Cursor as a client or enable auto-discovery, ToolHive
automatically updates the global MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP
server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations)
by creating a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) stores its global (user
scope) MCP configuration in a JSON file in your home directory.

- **All platforms**: `~/.claude.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  // Other Claude Code settings...

  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "http" }
  }
}
```

When you register Claude Code as a client or enable auto-discovery, ToolHive
automatically updates the global MCP configuration file whenever you run an MCP
server. You can also
[configure project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#understanding-mcp-server-scopes)
by creating a `.mcp.json` file in your project directory, or add servers using
the `claude` CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope <user|project> --transport sse fetch http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch
```

### Roo Code and Cline

[Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) (previously Roo Cline) and
[Cline](https://cline.bot/) store their global MCP configuration in their VS
Code extension settings directory. Both use the same configuration format.

**Roo Code**:

- **macOS**:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**:
  `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

**Cline**:

- **macOS**:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**:
  `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { "url": "http://localhost:19046/sse#github", "type": "sse" },
    "fetch": { "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch", "type": "sse" },
    "osv": { "url": "http://localhost:51712/mcp", "type": "streamable-http" }
  }
}
```

When you register Roo Code or Cline as a client or enable auto-discovery,
ToolHive automatically updates the global MCP configuration file whenever you
run an MCP server. With Roo Code, you can also configure
[project-specific MCP servers](https://docs.roocode.com/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo#editing-mcp-settings-files)
by creating a `.roo/mcp.json` file in your project directory.

## Manual configuration

If your client doesn't support automatic configuration, you'll need to set up
the MCP server URL manually.

### Example: PydanticAI

For [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), set the MCP server URL in your code:

```python
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerSSE
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHTTP

# For Server-Sent Events (SSE)
server = MCPServerSSE(url='http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch')

# For Streamable HTTP
server = MCPServerStreamableHTTP(url='http://localhost:51712/mcp')
```

### Example: Continue

For the [Continue](https://continue.dev) extension in VS Code or JetBrains, edit
your `~/.continue/config.yaml` file or project-specific
`.continue/mcpServers/<name>.yaml` file to include the MCP server URL:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: fetch
    type: sse
    url: http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch
```

Continue supports SSE (`type: sse`) and Streamable HTTP
(`type: streamable-http`) transports.

### Example: Copilot for JetBrains IDEs

For the
[GitHub Copilot plugin in JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
(IntelliJ, Pydantic, etc.), edit your `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json` file
to include the MCP server URL:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "fetch": {
      "url": "http://localhost:43832/sse#fetch",
      "type": "sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Copilot supports SSE (`"type": "sse"`) and Streamable HTTP
(`"type": "streamable-http"`) transports.
