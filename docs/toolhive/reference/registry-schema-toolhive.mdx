import Schema from '@site/static/api-specs/toolhive-legacy-registry.schema.json';

This is the JSON schema for the ToolHive-native registry format. It defines the
structure and constraints for registry entries, ensuring that all entries
conform to a consistent format.

:::info

This format is considered legacy now that an
[official upstream registry format](registry-schema-upstream.mdx) exists.
ToolHive supports both formats, and the ToolHive-native format continues to work
for the built-in registry, custom file-based registries, and the ToolHive
Registry Server.

:::

To use this schema in your own custom registry file, add a `$schema` property at
the top of your JSON file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/main/pkg/registry/data/toolhive-legacy-registry.schema.json",
  ...
}
```

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />
