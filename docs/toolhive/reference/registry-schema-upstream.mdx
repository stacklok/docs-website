This is the JSON schema for the official upstream MCP registry format. It
defines the structure and constraints for registry entries, ensuring that all
entries conform to a consistent format.

:::info

ToolHive also supports the
[ToolHive-native registry format](./registry-schema-toolhive.mdx), which is used
by the built-in registry. Both formats work with custom file-based registries
and the ToolHive Registry Server.

:::

To use this schema in your own custom registry file, add a `$schema` property at
the top of your JSON file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/main/pkg/registry/data/upstream-registry.schema.json",
  ...
}
```

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />
