description: How to get help and support for ToolHive
---

Whether you're troubleshooting an issue, looking for guidance, or need help with
your ToolHive deployment, there are several ways to get support. This page
outlines the available resources to help you find answers quickly.

## Self-help resources

### Documentation

This documentation site is your first stop for help. You can search using
keywords or ask questions using AI-powered search:

- **Keyword search**: Use the search bar at the top of the page to find specific
  topics, commands, or configuration options.
- **AI search**: Type a question in the search and select the **Ask AI** option
  to get relevant answers from the documentation.

### ToolHive documentation MCP server

For an enhanced documentation experience, you can use the ToolHive documentation
search MCP server. This server provides access to the ToolHive documentation
directly within your AI-powered tools, making it easy to get context-aware help
while you work.

ToolHive offers two ways to access the documentation server:

- **`toolhive-doc-mcp-remote`** (recommended): A hosted remote MCP server that's
  always up-to-date with the latest documentation.
- **`toolhive-doc-mcp`**: A containerized local version you can run on your
  machine.

Both versions are available in the ToolHive registry. The
[`toolhive-doc-mcp`](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/toolhive-doc-mcp) source
code is available on GitHub.

Once you've added the ToolHive documentation MCP server, you can ask your AI
assistant questions like "How do I configure ToolHive?" or "What are the
available commands?" and get answers directly from the documentation.

#### Using with the ToolHive UI

1. Open the ToolHive UI application.
2. Open the **Registry** page.
3. Search for `toolhive-doc` to find both versions.
4. Select `toolhive-doc-mcp-remote` (recommended) or `toolhive-doc-mcp` (local).
5. Review the pre-filled configuration and click **Install server** to start the
   MCP server.

The server will appear on the MCP Servers page with a "Running" status. The
documentation is now available to your connected AI clients.

See the [Run MCP servers](./guides-ui/run-mcp-servers.mdx) guide for more
details.

#### Using with the ToolHive CLI

To run the hosted remote version (recommended):

```bash
thv run toolhive-doc-mcp-remote
```

Or to run the local containerized version:

```bash
thv run toolhive-doc-mcp
```

Once started, the documentation will be available to any AI clients registered
with ToolHive. To verify the server is running:

```bash
thv list
```
