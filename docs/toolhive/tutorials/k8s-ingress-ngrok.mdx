title: Configure secure ingress for MCP servers on Kubernetes
description:
  A guide to setting up secure ingress for MCP servers running on a Kubernetes
  cluster using the ToolHive Operator.
---

In this tutorial, you'll configure secure ingress for MCP servers running on a
Kubernetes cluster using the ToolHive Operator. By the end, you'll have a
working MCP server accessible via a secure HTTPS endpoint that your team can
use.

You'll use the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](https://ngrok.com/docs/k8s) to create
secure tunnels to your MCP servers. This setup ensures that your MCP servers are
accessible over HTTPS, providing a secure way to interact with them. While this
tutorial uses ngrok for simplicity, you can apply similar principles with other
Kubernetes gateway solutions that work with the Kubernetes Gateway API, such as
[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/),
[Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/),
and
[many others](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/#implementations_1).

This tutorial demonstrates ngrok specifically. For general guidance on exposing
MCP servers with Ingress, Gateway API, or cloud provider implementations, see
[Connect clients to MCP servers](../guides-k8s/connect-clients.mdx).

## What you'll learn

This tutorial demonstrates how to make MCP servers available centrally for teams
and enterprises. By deploying MCP servers on Kubernetes with secure ingress, you
create a shared pool of capabilities that any team member can access. This
approach is valuable for organizations that want to provide standardized tools
and resources to developers while maintaining control over security, access
policies, and resource usage.

Once your MCP servers are accessible via HTTPS, users can quickly connect their
AI clients using the ToolHive CLI (`thv run`) or UI without needing to install
or configure individual MCP servers locally. This centralized model simplifies
deployment, improves consistency, and makes it easier to manage updates and
security patches.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to install and configure the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.
- How to create secure tunnels for MCP servers.
- How to access MCP servers via HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster with the ToolHive Operator installed. See the
  [Kubernetes quickstart guide](./quickstart-k8s.mdx) for instructions.
- `kubectl` command-line tool configured to interact with your cluster.
- An [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/) to obtain an authentication token. A
  free account is sufficient for this tutorial.
- The [ToolHive CLI](../guides-cli/install.mdx) to interact with the remote MCP
  server and connect it to your AI clients.

## Step 1: Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

These steps are a simplified version of the instructions found in the
[ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/gateway-api).

First, you'll need to install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator in your cluster
using Helm:

```bash
helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
helm repo update
```

Obtain your authentication token and create an API key from the ngrok dashboard,
then set them as environment variables:

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="your_ngrok_auth_token"
export NGROK_API_KEY="your_ngrok_api_key"
```

Install the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs and a GatewayClass resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.3.0/standard-install.yaml

kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: ngrok
spec:
  controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
EOF
```

Then, install the ngrok Operator using Helm:

```bash
helm install ngrok-operator ngrok/ngrok-operator \
--namespace ngrok-operator \
--create-namespace \
--set defaultDomainReclaimPolicy=Retain \
--set credentials.apiKey=$NGROK_API_KEY \
--set credentials.authtoken=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN
```

## Step 2: Deploy an MCP server

Next, deploy an MCP server using the ToolHive Operator. This example deploys the
["MKP" MCP server](../guides-mcp/k8s.mdx) to manage the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/refs/heads/main/examples/operator/mcp-servers/mcpserver_mkp.yaml
```

Get the MCP server's service details to identify the port to expose. The service
name follows the format `mcp-<MCP_SERVER_NAME>-proxy`. For the MKP example, the
service is `mcp-mkp-proxy` in the `toolhive-system` namespace on port `8080`:

```bash
kubectl get service mcp-mkp-proxy -n toolhive-system
```

The output should look similar to this:

```plaintext
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
mcp-mkp-proxy   ClusterIP   10.96.106.88   <none>        8080/TCP   2m19s
```

Note the service name and port number for the next step.

## Step 3: Create an ngrok Gateway resource

Now, create a Gateway and HTTPRoute resource to expose the MCP server securely
via ngrok.

For this step, you'll need to obtain your dev domain or custom domain from the
[ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains). If you have a free
account, it will be in the format `<RANDOM_NAME>.ngrok-free.app`. Replace
`<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>` with your actual domain in the YAML below.

Create a file named `ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml {12,29,35-37} title="ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml"
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ngrok-gateway
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  gatewayClassName: ngrok
  listeners:
    - name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
      port: 443
      hostname: <YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: mkp-mcp-route
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: ngrok-gateway
      namespace: toolhive-system
  hostnames:
    - <YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: mcp-mkp-proxy # Replace with your service name from Step 2
          port: 8080 # Replace with your port number from Step 2
```

Apply the configuration to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml
```

## Step 4: Access the MCP server

After a few moments, the ngrok Operator will create a secure tunnel to your MCP
server. You can access it using the domain you specified in the Gateway
resource.

Use the ToolHive CLI to verify connectivity to the MCP server:

```bash
thv mcp list tools --server https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/mcp
```

The output should display a list of tools managed by the MCP server, confirming
that you have successfully set up secure ingress using ngrok. For the "MKP" MCP
server, you should see output similar to this:

```plaintext
TOOLS:
NAME             DESCRIPTION
get_resource     Get a Kubernetes resource or its subresource
list_resources   List Kubernetes resources
```

Use the ToolHive CLI or UI to connect your AI clients to the MCP server:

```bash
thv run --name mkp https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/mcp
```

The MKP MCP server is now available to AI clients configured with
`thv client setup` via a secure HTTPS endpoint.

## Optional: Tunnel multiple MCP servers with URL rewrites

If you have multiple MCP servers and want to expose them via the same ngrok
Gateway, you can use URL rewrites in the `HTTPRoute` resource. This allows you
to route requests to different MCP servers based on path prefixes.

:::note

This option consumes $1 of the $5 credit included with the free ngrok account to
enable the traffic policies feature or requires a paid ngrok plan.

:::

Run a second MCP server, for example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/refs/heads/main/examples/operator/mcp-servers/mcpserver_fetch.yaml
```

Then, update the `ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml` file. Update the `rules` section of
the existing `HTTPRoute` resource to give the MKP MCP server a path prefix of
`/mkp` and add a `URLRewrite` filter.

```yaml {8,12-17} title="ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml"
# ... existing HTTPRoute resource ...
spec:
  # ... existing spec ...
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /mkp
      backendRefs:
        - name: mcp-mkp-proxy
          port: 8080
      filters:
        - type: URLRewrite
          urlRewrite:
            path:
              type: ReplacePrefixMatch
              replacePrefixMatch: ''
```

Then, add a new rule for the Fetch MCP server with a path prefix of `/fetch`,
again replacing `<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>` with your actual domain:

```yaml {14,19,21-22} title="ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml"
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: fetch-mcp-route
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: ngrok-gateway
      namespace: toolhive-system
  hostnames:
    - <YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /fetch
      backendRefs:
        - name: mcp-fetch-proxy
          port: 8080
      filters:
        - type: URLRewrite
          urlRewrite:
            path:
              type: ReplacePrefixMatch
              replacePrefixMatch: ''
```

At this point, your `ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml` file should contain one `Gateway`
resource and two `HTTPRoute` resources.

            path:
              type: ReplacePrefixMatch
              replacePrefixMatch: ""
```
</details>

Apply the updated configuration to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml
```

You can now access both MCP servers using the same ngrok domain with different
path prefixes:

```bash
thv mcp list tools --server https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/mkp/mcp
thv mcp list tools --server https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/fetch/mcp
```

Use the ToolHive CLI or UI to connect your AI clients to either MCP server:

```bash
thv run --name mkp https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/mkp/mcp
thv run --name fetch https://<YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN>/fetch/mcp
```

## Clean up

To remove the ngrok resources from your cluster and ngrok account, run the
following:

```bash
# Delete the Gateway and HTTPRoute resources
kubectl delete -f ngrok-mcp-gateway.yaml

# Delete the ngrok CRDs
kubectl delete $(kubectl get crd -o name | grep "ngrok")

# Uninstall the ngrok Operator
helm uninstall ngrok-operator -n ngrok-operator
kubectl delete namespace ngrok-operator
```

## What's next?

Now that you have secure ingress configured for your MCP servers, consider these
next steps:

- Explore [authentication and authorization](../concepts/auth-framework.mdx) to
  control access to your MCP servers.
- Learn about [observability](../concepts/observability.mdx) to monitor your MCP
  server usage and performance.
- Try other gateway solutions like Traefik or Istio if they're already part of
  your infrastructure.
