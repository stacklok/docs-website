In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy the ToolHive Kubernetes operator
and use it to manage MCP servers in a Kubernetes cluster. By the end, you'll
have a working operator deployment that automatically manages MCP servers using
Kubernetes resources.

## What you'll learn

- How to set up a local Kubernetes cluster with kind
- How to deploy the ToolHive operator to your cluster
- How to create your first MCP server using Kubernetes resources
- How to verify that your MCP server is running correctly
- How to connect an AI agent (like GitHub Copilot) to your MCP server

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (v3.10 minimum, v3.14+
  recommended) installed
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or
  [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads) installed and running
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) installed
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services)
- An MCP client (VS Code with Copilot is used in this tutorial, but you can use
  any [supported client](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx))

## Quickstart with Task (TL;DR)

If you want to get up and running quickly and have
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed, you can use our automated
setup:

1. Clone the ToolHive repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive.git
   cd toolhive
   ```

2. Run the automated setup:

   ```bash
   task kind-with-toolhive-operator
   ```

This creates the kind cluster, installs an nginx ingress controller, and deploys
the latest ToolHive operator image. You should see output indicating successful
cluster creation and operator deployment. Once complete, skip to
[Step 3: Create your first MCP server](#step-3-create-your-first-mcp-server) to
continue with the tutorial.

If you prefer to understand each step or don't have Task installed, continue
with the manual setup below.

## Step 1: Create a kind cluster

First, create a local Kubernetes cluster using kind. This gives you a safe
environment to experiment with the ToolHive operator.

Create a cluster named `toolhive`:

```bash
kind create cluster --name toolhive
```

Verify your cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:xxxxx
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

This confirms your cluster is running and ready for the ToolHive operator.

:::info[What's happening?]

Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker
containers. This is perfect for development and testing because it's isolated
from your main system and can be easily deleted when you're done.

:::

## Step 2: Deploy the ToolHive operator

Now deploy the ToolHive operator to your cluster using Helm. The operator will
watch for MCP server resources and manage their lifecycle automatically.

First, install the operator CRDs:

```bash
helm upgrade --install toolhive-operator-crds oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator-crds
```

Then install the operator:

```bash
helm upgrade --install toolhive-operator oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator -n toolhive-system --create-namespace
```

Verify that the operator deployed successfully:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n toolhive-system
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
toolhive-operator-xxx   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

If the pod shows "Running" status, your operator is ready to manage MCP servers.

:::info[What's happening?]

The ToolHive operator is a Kubernetes controller that watches for `MCPServer`
resources. When you create an `MCPServer` resource, the operator automatically
creates the necessary pods, services, and configurations to run that MCP server
in your cluster.

:::

## Step 3: Create your first MCP server

Now for the exciting part - create an MCP server using Kubernetes resources.
You'll deploy the fetch server, which allows AI agents to retrieve web content.

Apply the example `fetch` MCP server from the ToolHive repository:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/refs/heads/main/examples/operator/mcp-servers/mcpserver_fetch.yaml
```

:::info[What's happening?]

When you create an `MCPServer` resource, the ToolHive operator detects it and
automatically:

1. Creates a deployment to run the MCP server container
2. Sets up a service to expose the server
3. Configures the necessary networking and security settings

:::

Check that your MCP server was created successfully:

```bash
kubectl get mcpservers -n toolhive-system
```

You should see:

```text
NAME    STATUS    URL                                                             AGE
fetch   Running   http://mcp-fetch-proxy.toolhive-system.svc.cluster.local:8080   30s
```

If the status is "Pending", wait a few moments and check again. If it remains
pending for a long time, see the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) at
the end of this tutorial.

## Step 4: Test your MCP server

Verify that your MCP server is actually working. First, get the service details:

```bash
kubectl get service mcp-fetch-proxy -n toolhive-system
```

Port-forward to access the service locally:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/mcp-fetch-proxy -n toolhive-system 8080:8080
```

In another terminal, test the server:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

You should see a response of `OK`.

This confirms your MCP server is running and responding correctly.

:::info[What's happening?]

The ToolHive operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service for each MCP
server. This service provides a stable network endpoint that other applications
(like AI agents) can use to communicate with your MCP server.

:::

## Step 5: Connect your AI client to the MCP server

Now that your MCP server is running in Kubernetes, connect it to an AI client
application. We'll use Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot as an example.

Make sure you still have the port-forward running from Step 4. If not, restart
it in a separate terminal:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/mcp-fetch-proxy -n toolhive-system 8080:8080
```

Configure Visual Studio Code to connect to your MCP server. Open VS Code and
access your user settings:

1. Open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "MCP: Add Server..." and select it

<ThemedImage
  alt='VS Code user settings in command palette'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-settings-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-settings-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='VS Code user settings in command palette'
  width='800'
  className='screenshot'
/>

3. Select "HTTP" as the server type

4. Enter the server URL: `http://localhost:8080/mcp` and press Enter

5. Enter a name for the server (e.g., "fetch") and press Enter

6. Choose "Global" to add the server to your global settings

7. VS Code adds the server and opens the MCP settings file. It should look like
   this:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "fetch": {
         "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
         "type": "http"
       }
     },
     "inputs": []
   }
   ```

To verify the connection, click **Start**. The indicator should change to
"Running" and show "1 tools".

<ThemedImage
  alt='VS Code MCP settings'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-mcp-start-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-mcp-start-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='VS Code MCP settings'
  width='450'
  className='screenshot'
/>
<ThemedImage
  alt='VS Code MCP running'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-mcp-running-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-mcp-running-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='VS Code MCP running'
  width='450'
  className='screenshot'
/>

Now test the connection by asking GitHub Copilot to fetch content from a
website. Open Copilot Chat in **Agent** mode and ask: "Can you fetch the content
from https://stacklok.com and summarize it for me?"

<ThemedImage
  alt='VS Code Copilot agent mode selection'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-agent-mode-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-agent-mode-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='VS Code Copilot agent mode selection'
  width='560'
  className='screenshot'
/>

GitHub Copilot should be able to use your Kubernetes-hosted MCP server to
retrieve the content and provide a summary.

<ThemedImage
  alt='VS Code Copilot tool use confirmation'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-tool-use-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/toolhive/quickstart/vscode-tool-use-dark.webp'),
  }}
  title='VS Code Copilot tool use confirmation'
  width='570'
  className='screenshot'
/>

:::info[What's happening?]

You're manually configuring VS Code to connect to your MCP server running in
Kubernetes. The port-forward creates a tunnel from your local machine
(port 8080) to the Kubernetes service, allowing GitHub Copilot to communicate
with the server using the Streamable HTTP protocol.

:::

## Step 6: Explore operator features

Now that you have a working MCP server, explore some operator features.

View the detailed status of your MCP server:

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver fetch -n toolhive-system
```

This shows you the current state, any events, and configuration details.

Try updating your MCP server's resource limits by editing the resource:

```bash
kubectl patch mcpserver fetch -n toolhive-system --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"limits":{"memory":"256Mi"}}}}'
```

You should see output confirming the patch:

```text
mcpserver.toolhive.stacklok.dev/fetch patched
```

Check that the pod has been updated with the new resource limits:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n toolhive-system -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=fetch -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].resources.limits.memory}'
```

You should see output showing the updated memory limit:

```text
256Mi
```

This demonstrates how the operator automatically updates the underlying pod when
you modify the MCPServer resource.

## Step 7: Clean up

When you're done experimenting, you can clean up your resources.

Delete the MCP server:

```bash
kubectl delete mcpserver fetch -n toolhive-system
```

Verify it's been removed:

```bash
kubectl get mcpservers -n toolhive-system
```

You should see:

```text
No resources found in toolhive-system namespace.
```

Check that the pods are also gone:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=fetch -n toolhive-system
```

You should see:

```text
No resources found in toolhive-system namespace.
```

:::info[What's happening?]

When you delete an `MCPServer` resource, the operator automatically cleans up
all the associated Kubernetes resources (pods, services, etc.). This ensures no
orphaned resources are left behind.

:::

When you're completely finished, delete the kind cluster:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name toolhive
```

:::tip[For Task users]

If you followed the [TL;DR setup](#quickstart-with-task-tldr) using Task, you
can also run:

```bash
task kind-destroy
```

This will fully remove the kind cluster and clean up all associated resources.

## What's next?

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed the ToolHive operator and created
your first MCP server using Kubernetes resources. You now have a working
Kubernetes environment where MCP servers are automatically managed by the
operator.

Here are some next steps to explore:

- Learn about
  [advanced MCP server configurations](../guides-k8s/run-mcp-k8s.mdx) for
  production deployments
- Learn more about
  [Helm deployment options](../guides-k8s/deploy-operator-helm.mdx) and
  configuration
- Integrate MCP servers with your existing Kubernetes applications
- Try deploying other MCP servers from the ToolHive registry

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Operator pod not starting</summary>

If the operator pod isn't starting, check the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n toolhive-system deployment/toolhive-operator
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>MCP server stuck in pending state</summary>

Check the operator logs to see what's happening:

```bash
kubectl logs -n toolhive-system deployment/toolhive-operator -f
```

Also check if there are any resource constraints:

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver fetch -n toolhive-system
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can't access MCP server</summary>

Verify the service is created and has endpoints:

```bash
kubectl get service mcp-fetch-proxy -n toolhive-system
kubectl get endpoints mcp-fetch-proxy -n toolhive-system
```
