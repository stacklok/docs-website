  A step-by-step guide to installing the ToolHive desktop application and
  running your first MCP server.
---

In this tutorial, you'll install the ToolHive desktop application and run your
first MCP server. By the end, you'll have a working MCP server that can fetch
content from websites and be used by AI applications like GitHub Copilot or
Cursor.

## What you'll learn

- How to install ToolHive on your system
- How to find available MCP servers
- How to run an MCP server
- How to use the server with an AI client application

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or
  [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads) or
  [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) installed and running
- A [supported MCP client](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx) like GitHub
  Copilot in VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and more

## Step 1: Install the ToolHive UI

First, download and run the ToolHive installer for your system.

- **macOS**: download the DMG installer for
  [Apple silicon](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive-arm64.dmg)
  or
  [Intel-based](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive-x64.dmg)
  Macs and copy the ToolHive application to your Applications folder
- **Windows**: download and run the
  [installer](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive.Setup.exe)

- **Linux**: download the RPM or DEB package from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest)
  and install it using your package manager.

For more detailed installation instructions, see the
[installing ToolHive](../guides-ui/install.mdx) guide.

## Step 2: Find an MCP server to run

On the initial splash screen, click **Browse registry**, or open the
**Registry** page from the top menu bar. This page lists the MCP servers in
ToolHive's built-in registry.

:::info[What is this?]

ToolHive maintains a curated registry of MCP servers that have been verified to
work correctly. The registry includes information about what each server does
and how to use it.

:::

For this tutorial, you'll use the "fetch" server, which is a simple MCP server
that lets AI agents get the contents of a website. Click on the "fetch" server
to start the installation process.

## Step 3: Install the Fetch MCP server

The Fetch MCP server doesn't require any special configuration, so you can
install it with the default settings. Click the **Install server** button to
start the installation.

Once the server is installed, it will appear on the **MCP Servers** page.

:::info[What's happening?]

ToolHive downloads the container image for the fetch server, creates a container
with the appropriate security settings, and starts the server. It also sets up a
proxy process that lets your AI agent communicate with the server.

:::

## Step 4: Connect an AI client

On the **Clients** page, you'll see the supported AI clients that ToolHive can
manage for you. When you connect a client, ToolHive configures it to use the MCP
servers you have installed.

Click the toggle switch to connect the client you want to use.

:::info[What's happening?]

When you connect a supported client, ToolHive automatically configures it to use
MCP servers that you install. This means you don't have to manually configure
the client each time you run an MCP server.

:::

## Step 5: Use the MCP server with your client

Now that your MCP server is running and your client is connected to ToolHive,
you can use the MCP server's tools. Open your client and ask the AI to fetch
content from a website. Note that you might need to restart your client for the
changes to take effect.

For example, try asking: "Can you fetch the content from https://toolhive.dev
and summarize it for me?"

The AI should be able to use the Fetch MCP server to retrieve the content and
provide a summary.

:::info[What's happening?]

When you ask the AI agent to fetch content, the large language model (LLM)
determines that it needs external data. It discovers the fetch tool provided by
your MCP server, instructs the agent to execute the tool with the URL you
specified, then receives and processes the webpage content to create a summary.

## What's next?

Congratulations! You've successfully installed ToolHive and run your first MCP
server. Here are some next steps to explore:

- Learn more about MCP concepts in the
  [MCP primer guide](../concepts/mcp-primer.md)
- Try [running more MCP servers](../guides-ui/run-mcp-servers.md) from the
  registry or from custom sources
- Learn about [secrets management](../guides-ui/secrets-management.md) for MCP
  servers that require authentication
- Learn how to
  [manually configure clients](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx#manual-configuration)
  that ToolHive doesn't automatically configure

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Server fails to start</summary>

If the server fails to start, check:

- Is Docker, Podman or Colima running?
- Do you have internet access to pull the container image?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Client can't use the server</summary>

If your AI client application can't use the server:

- Make sure your client is connected to ToolHive (see Step 4)
- Restart your client to pick up the new configuration
- Verify the server is running on the **MCP Servers** page
- Disconnect and reconnect the client in ToolHive to refresh the configuration
