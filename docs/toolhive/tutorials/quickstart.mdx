In this tutorial, you'll install ToolHive and run your first MCP server. By the
end, you'll have a working MCP server that can fetch content from websites and
be used by AI applications like GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

## What you'll learn

- How to install ToolHive on your system
- How to find available MCP servers
- How to run an MCP server
- How to verify the server is working
- How to use the server with an AI client application

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or
  [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads) installed and running
- A [supported MCP client](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx) like GitHub
  Copilot in VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and more

## Step 1: Install ToolHive

First, install ToolHive on your system. ToolHive provides the `thv` command-line
tool that manages MCP servers in secure containers.

For detailed installation instructions, see the
[installing ToolHive](../guides-cli/install.mdx) guide. Here's a quick summary:

<Tabs groupId='installer' queryString='installer'>
  <TabItem value='homebrew' label='Homebrew (macOS/Linux)' default>

    ```bash
    brew tap stacklok/tap
    brew install thv
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='winget' label='WinGet (Windows)' default>

    ```bash
    winget install stacklok.thv
    ```

    Open a new terminal window after installation to ensure the `thv` command is
    available.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='binary' label='Pre-compiled binaries'>

    Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the
    [ToolHive releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/releases).

    ```bash
    # Extract the archive
    tar -xzf toolhive_<version>_<platform>.tar.gz
    # Move the binary to a directory in your PATH
    sudo mv thv /usr/local/bin/
    # Make it executable (if needed)
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/thv
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify your installation

After installing, verify that ToolHive is working correctly:

```bash
thv version
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text
ToolHive v0.0.38
Commit: c321ba873f5dcb1d33035d4f8496eb3e22f8b37e
Built: 2025-05-29 12:03:02 UTC
Go version: go1.24.1
Platform: darwin/arm64
```

This confirms ToolHive is installed and ready to use.

## Step 2: Register your client

Next, run the ToolHive client setup command to register your MCP client:

```bash
thv client setup
```

Select one or more clients from the list using the spacebar to toggle selection.
Press Enter to confirm your selection.

:::info What's happening?

When you run the setup command, ToolHive automatically finds
[supported clients](../reference/client-compatibility.mdx) on your system. When
you register a client, ToolHive automatically configures it to use MCP servers
that you run. This means you don't have to manually configure the client to
connect to the MCP server.

:::

Confirm that your client is registered successfully:

```bash
thv client status
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text
┌────────────────┬───────────┬────────────┐
│ CLIENT TYPE    │ INSTALLED │ REGISTERED │
├────────────────┼───────────┼────────────┤
│ vscode         │ ✅ Yes    │ ❌ No      │
└────────────────┴───────────┴────────────┘
```

## Step 3: Find an MCP server to run

See what MCP servers are available in the registry:

```bash
thv registry list
```

You'll see output similar to this:

```text
NAME       DESCRIPTION                                                    TIER        STARS   PULLS
atlassian  Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Atlassian product...   Community   2194    7789

...
```

This shows all the MCP servers available in the ToolHive registry.

:::info What's happening?

ToolHive maintains a curated registry of MCP servers that have been verified to
work correctly. The registry includes information about what each server does
and how to use it.

:::

For this tutorial, you'll use the "fetch" server, which is a simple MCP server
that lets AI agents get the contents of a website. To learn more about the
server before running it, run:

```bash
thv registry info fetch
```

This shows you detailed information about the server, including what tools it
provides and any configuration options.

## Step 4: Run the Fetch MCP server

Now, run the Fetch server:

```bash
thv run fetch
```

ToolHive will pull the container image and start the server. You'll see output
similar to this:

```text
Image [mcp/fetch:latest] has 'latest' tag, pulling to ensure we have the most recent version...
Pulling image: [mcp/fetch:latest]
...
Successfully pulled image: [mcp/fetch:latest]
Using host port: [49226]
Logging to: [~/Library/Application Support/toolhive/logs/fetch.log]
MCP server is running in the background (PID: [80087])
Use 'thv stop [fetch]' to stop the server
```

:::info What's happening?

ToolHive downloads the container image for the fetch server (if you don't
already have it), creates a container with the appropriate security settings,
and starts the server. It also sets up a proxy that lets your AI agent
communicate with the server.

:::

## Step 5: Verify the server is running

Check that the server is running:

```bash
thv list
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text
NAME    PACKAGE            STATUS    URL                                PORT    TOOL TYPE   CREATED AT
fetch   mcp/fetch:latest   running   http://127.0.0.1:15266/sse#fetch   15266   mcp         2025-06-30 09:12:53 -0400 EDT
```

This confirms that the fetch server is running and available on port 49226.

:::info What's happening?

ToolHive keeps track of all the MCP servers it's managing. The
[`list`](../reference/cli/thv_list.md) command shows you which servers are
running and how they're configured.

:::

## Step 6: Use the MCP server with your AI client

Now that your MCP server is running, you can use it with your AI client
application. Open your supported client (VS Code, Cursor, etc.) and ask the AI
to fetch content from a website. Note that you might need to restart your client
for the changes to take effect.

For example, try asking: "Can you fetch the content from https://stacklok.com
and summarize it for me?"

The AI should be able to use the Fetch MCP server to retrieve the content and
provide a summary.

:::info What's happening?

When you ask the AI to fetch content, it detects that it needs external data. It
discovers the fetch tool provided by your MCP server, calls the tool with the
URL you specified, receives the webpage content, and then processes that content
to create a summary.

:::

## Step 7: Stop the server when you're done

When you're finished using the server, you can stop it:

```bash
thv stop fetch
```

If you want to remove it completely:

```bash
thv rm fetch
```

:::info What's happening?

Stopping a server pauses it and terminates the associated proxy process but
keeps the container around so you can restart it quickly later using
[`thv restart`](../reference/cli/thv_restart.md) or
[`thv run`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md). Removing a server completely deletes
the container, freeing up resources.

:::

## What's next?

Congratulations! You've successfully installed ToolHive and run your first MCP
server. Here are some next steps to explore:

- Try running other MCP servers from the registry with
  [`thv registry list`](../reference/cli/thv_registry_list.md) and
  [`thv run <server-name>`](../reference/cli/thv_run.md)
- Learn about [secrets management](../guides-cli/secrets-management.mdx) for MCP
  servers that require authentication
- Explore [custom permissions](../guides-cli/custom-permissions.mdx) for MCP
  servers
- Set up [shell completion](../guides-cli/install.mdx#enable-shell-completion)
  to make ToolHive commands easier to use
- Learn how to [upgrade ToolHive](../guides-cli/install.mdx#upgrade-toolhive)
  when new versions are available

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Server fails to start</summary>

If the server fails to start, check:

- Is Docker or Podman running?
- Do you have internet access to pull the container image?
- Is the port already in use by another application?

Try running with a specific port:

```bash
thv run --port 8081 fetch
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Client can't use the server</summary>

If your AI client application can't use the server:

- Make sure your client is registered with ToolHive (see Step 2)
- Check that your client is supported
- Restart your client to pick up the new configuration
- Verify the server is running with [`thv list`](../reference/cli/thv_list.md)
